// RpcMixin — class mixin for LitElement components that need RPC access.
//
// Two things it solves:
//
// 1. Subscription plumbing. Every component that makes an RPC call
//    needs to subscribe to the SharedRpc singleton's ready/disconnect
//    events, check initial state, and update a reactive property so
//    templates can guard against not-yet-ready state. Writing this
//    per-component is tedious and error-prone; the mixin does it once.
//
// 2. First-call microtask deferral. When `rpc-ready` fires, multiple
//    components' event listeners dispatch synchronously in registration
//    order. If component A's listener immediately issues a call that
//    triggers a broadcast event (e.g. `reset_to_head`, which the server
//    follows with a `filesModified` push), component B — registered later
//    in the same tick — might not have run yet, leaving B in an
//    inconsistent state (receives the broadcast before thinking it's
//    connected).
//
//    The mixin schedules each component's `onRpcReady` hook on the
//    next microtask via `queueMicrotask`. Every synchronous listener
//    gets to update state first; only then do the hooks fire.
//
// Usage:
//
//   import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';
//   import { RpcMixin } from './rpc-mixin.js';
//
//   class FilePicker extends RpcMixin(LitElement) {
//     async onRpcReady() {
//       // Called on the microtask following the proxy publication.
//       // Safe to issue calls here; all sibling components have
//       // already updated their connection state.
//       this.tree = await this.rpcExtract('Repo.get_file_tree');
//     }
//
//     render() {
//       if (!this.rpcConnected) return html`<p>connecting…</p>`;
//       // ... use this.tree ...
//     }
//   }
