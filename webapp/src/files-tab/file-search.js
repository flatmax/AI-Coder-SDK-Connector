// File-search bridge between the chat panel and the
// picker.
//
// When the user enters file-search mode in the chat
// panel, the picker shows a pruned tree of matching
// files. This module owns the four event handlers
// that bridge the two components:
//
//   - `file-clicked` routing: during search, route to
//     the chat panel's match-overlay scroll instead
//     of opening the file
//   - `file-search-changed`: enter / update / exit
//     search mode on the picker
//   - `filter-from-chat`: live-forward `@pattern`
//     input from the chat textarea to the picker's
//     filter
//   - `file-search-scroll`: keep the picker's focused
//     row in sync with the chat-side overlay
//
// State on the host: `_fileSearchActive` boolean,
// non-reactive. Read by `onFileClicked` to choose
// between viewer-open and overlay-scroll.

 * the match overlay to that file rather than opening
 * it. We route to the chat panel's
