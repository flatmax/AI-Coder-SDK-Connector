// SharedRpc — singleton holder for the jrpc-oo call proxy.
//
// Layer 5 gives us exactly one root component (AppShell) owning
// exactly one WebSocket connection. Rather than passing a reference
// through the DOM tree or component properties, the root publishes
// the call proxy to this singleton; child components subscribe via
// RpcMixin. This mirrors the pattern documented in
// specs4/1-foundation/rpc-transport.md#rpc-distribution-to-child-components
// (from the specs3 detail reference — the specs4 stub defers the
// exact mechanism to us; this is our implementation choice).
//
// The singleton is deliberately simple — an EventTarget with two
// methods and two state fields. No framework magic, no reactive
// bindings, nothing that can't be tested with a plain object.
//
// Test hook — `reset()` wipes state between test cases. Not part of
// the production contract; production code never calls it.

 * - `rpc-disconnected` — fired when `set(null)` is called.
 *                   No detail.

/**
 * Unwrap a jrpc-oo broadcast result.
 *
 * The `call` proxy (returned by `this.call['Cls.method'](args)` on the
 * JRPCClient) resolves to an object keyed by remote UUID:
 *
 *   { 'uuid-of-server-1': <actual result> }
 *
 * In single-remote operation (the common case — one browser, one
 * backend) there is always exactly one key. Components want the
 * inner value, not the envelope. `rpcExtract` pulls out the first
 * value of a single-key object.
 *
 * If the result has multiple keys (multi-remote broadcast — rare in
 * practice since read operations return identical state across
 * remotes), we still return the first value. This is the convention
 * specs3's RpcMixin used and Layer 4's collaboration code depends on:
 * "first key wins for read operations". Callers that care about
 * per-remote results use `rpcCall` instead and inspect the envelope
 * themselves.
 *
 * If the result isn't a plain object (scalar, array, null), or has
 * zero keys, it's returned unchanged — the unwrap is a no-op. This
 * keeps the helper total: it never corrupts a method that genuinely
 * returns `null` or a primitive.
 *
 * @param {*} result — a resolved jrpc-oo response
 * @returns {*} — the unwrapped value, or `result` itself if no
 *   single-key shape was detected

  // but a method that genuinely returns an array shouldn't be
  // mutated by this helper either.)

/**
 * Reject a call that never gets an answer.
 *
 * A jrpc-oo call issued while the socket is being replaced — a reload
 * mid-reconnect is the reliable way to see it — is dropped without a
 * reply, and the promise then neither resolves nor rejects. That is
 * survivable on its own. What is not is the `if (inFlight) return;`
 * guard nearly every fetch here uses: the flag is cleared in a
 * `finally`, the `finally` never runs, and the component stops fetching
 * for the rest of the session. Found live — the usage HUD's context
 * section went permanently blank after one dropped reply, and the
 * Context tab's Refresh button stays disabled in the same state.
 *
 * Opt-in rather than folded into `rpcCall`, because some calls
 * genuinely run for minutes (a document conversion, an index rebuild)
 * and a blanket deadline would break them. Use it for reads that are
 * idempotent and retriable on the next event.
 *
 * Pick `ms` *above* whatever deadline the backend method already has,
 * not below it. Every `ClaudeCodeService` method converts its own
 * failures into an `{error}` return, so the backend always replies —
 * and a deadline shorter than its means giving up on a reply that is
 * still coming, then stacking a retry onto whatever was too slow to
 * answer the first. What is left once the backend can't be beaten to
 * the punch is the only case this helper is for: no reply at all.
 *
 * The underlying call is not cancelled — nothing in jrpc-oo can — so a
 * late reply is simply ignored.
 *
 * @param {Promise<any>} promise The in-flight call.
 * @param {number} ms Deadline in milliseconds.
 * @param {string} label Method name, for the error message.
 * @returns {Promise<any>} Settles with the call, or rejects at `ms`.

 *      `rpc-ready` fires — the *same* shared instance, so components
 *      re-subscribe by virtue of still having their listener attached.
