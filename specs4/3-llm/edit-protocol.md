# Edit Protocol

The LLM proposes file changes using a structured edit block format. Each block contains old text (exact copy from the file, searched as a contiguous block) and new text (its complete replacement). Blocks are parsed from the streaming response, validated against file content, and applied sequentially.

## Block Structure

Each edit block has four literal marker lines bracketing two content sections:

1. A line containing the file path (relative to repo root)
2. Start marker: `🟧🟧🟧 EDIT`
3. Old text — exact copy from the file (the anchor)
4. Separator marker: `🟨🟨🟨 REPL`
5. New text — the replacement content
6. End marker: `🟩🟩🟩 END`

### Delimiter Lines — Exact Form

Each delimiter appears on its own line with nothing else on that line:

- Start: `🟧🟧🟧 EDIT` — three orange squares (U+1F7E7), space, literal `EDIT`
- Separator: `🟨🟨🟨 REPL` — three yellow squares (U+1F7E8), space, literal `REPL`
- End: `🟩🟩🟩 END` — three green squares (U+1F7E9), space, literal `END`

The emoji prefix varies by marker role (orange/yellow/green = start/middle/end) so a block is visually distinguishable from prose at any zoom and any theme. The color sequence also makes malformed blocks (missing separator, missing end) obvious during review.

### Agent-Spawn Blocks (Reserved Marker)

A second block type — **agent-spawn blocks** — uses a distinct marker pair with no middle separator:

- Start: `🟧🟧🟧 AGENT` — three orange squares, space, literal `AGENT`
- End: `🟩🟩🟩 AGEND` — three green squares, space, literal `AGEND`

Body is a minimal YAML-ish payload of `key: value` pairs. See [parallel-agents.md — Agent-spawn block format](../7-future/parallel-agents.md#agent-spawn-block-format) for the full shape.

This marker is **reserved for future use**. Parallel-agent mode is not part of the initial clean-room build (see [parallel-agents.md](../7-future/parallel-agents.md) — "not for implementation"). The current single-agent system's edit parser treats `🟧🟧🟧 AGENT` and `🟩🟩🟩 AGEND` lines as prose; a future agent-spawning implementation will add branches to the parser's state machine that recognise the `AGENT` keyword and route the block to the agent spawner instead of the edit pipeline.

The end markers differ between block types on purpose. If agent blocks reused `🟩🟩🟩 END`, a parser scanning line-by-line would have to track which start marker opened the current block to decide what the end marker closes — brittle under malformed input, and it forces the frontend display parser and the backend apply parser to stay in lockstep on state tracking. With distinct end markers, each parser dispatches on the literal line: `🟩🟩🟩 END` closes edits, `🟩🟩🟩 AGEND` closes agents, no state disambiguation needed. An LLM response that interleaves both block types, or a document quoting both in the same code fence, cannot cause one marker to accidentally terminate the other's block.

The absence of a middle separator (no `🟨🟨🟨`-style line inside agent blocks) further distinguishes agent blocks from edit blocks at glance.

### Example

```
src/math.py
🟧🟧🟧 EDIT
def multiply(a, b):
    return a + b  # BUG
🟨🟨🟨 REPL
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
🟩🟩🟩 END
```

The LLM must reproduce the marker characters exactly — no ASCII substitutions, no added punctuation, no translation. Parsers match on the literal byte sequences.

## How Matching Works

- The entire old-text section is searched in the file as a contiguous block of lines
- When exactly one match is found, the new-text section replaces it completely
- Zero matches — fail (anchor not found)
- Multiple matches — fail (ambiguous anchor)
- More surrounding context lines should be included when disambiguation is needed

## Operations

- Modify — old text with context in old section, modified version in new section
- Insert after — context line(s) in old section, context plus new lines in new section
- Create file — empty old section, content only in new section
- Delete lines — lines to delete with context in old section, just context in new section
- Delete file — not via edit blocks; suggest shell command
- Rename file — not via edit blocks; suggest shell command

## Multiple Edits to the Same File

- Applied sequentially top to bottom
- After edit A, edit B's old text must match the file *after* A
- Adjacent or overlapping edits should be merged into one block
- Merge rules — overlapping, adjacent within a few lines, or having sequential dependencies

## Parsing State Machine

- Scanning — looking for a file path pattern
- Expect edit — file path found, waiting for start marker
- Reading old — accumulating old-text lines until separator
- Reading new — accumulating new-text lines until end marker
- Emit block on end marker

## File Path Detection

- Not a comment (doesn't start with common comment prefixes or triple backticks)
- Path with separators (slash or backslash) — inner whitespace permitted
- Filename with extension — inner whitespace permitted (`deployment modes.md`)
- Dotfile without extension
- Bare extensionless tokens (LICENSE, Makefile, README, AUTHORS, ...) — single-word lines without inner whitespace
- Path appears immediately before start marker, with blank lines causing state reset; the start marker on the next line is what disambiguates a path declaration from a stray bare-word line in prose

The whole line is the path, spaces included. Filenames containing spaces must be editable: rejecting them means the start marker falls through as prose, the parser emits zero blocks, and — because there is no block — there is no result to report, so the failure is invisible rather than diagnosed. Accepting a path-shaped prose line costs nothing by comparison; the start-marker lookahead discards it, and if a marker really does follow, the user gets a file-not-found diagnostic.

## Frontend vs Backend Path Detection

- Each has its own file-path predicate — they are intentionally not identical
- Frontend is simpler (display-only); backend is authoritative
- Frontend may miss extensionless filenames like Makefile — block still applies correctly server-side
- Whitespace handling must NOT diverge — a path the backend accepts and the frontend rejects renders as prose while applying to disk, so the user sees a successful edit as an ignored one
- Frontend holds (does not drop) blank and fence lines consumed while a path candidate is unresolved, replaying them as text if the candidate turns out to be prose

## Streaming Considerations

- Partially received blocks tracked across chunks
- Parser maintains state across chunks
- Only completed blocks are applied

## Validation

- File exists (for modifications, not creates)
- File is not binary (null byte check)
- Old text found exactly once in the file
- New text contains no bare separator line (malformed-block guard, below)

### Malformed-Block Guard — Stray Separator

A block whose new text contains a **bare `🟨🟨🟨 REPL` line** is refused with a validation error and never written. Checked before the create/modify split, so both writing paths are covered, and ahead of the not-in-context check — the defect is in the block itself, so deferring it to a retry gains nothing.

This is the only malformation in the protocol that damages a file while reporting success. The state machine consumes the first separator on the read-old → read-new transition, so a second one accumulates as new-text *content*: the edit applies cleanly, the marker lands in the user's document as literal text, and the result says `applied`. Every other malformation fails safe — a bad path drops the block, a missing end marker leaves it incomplete.

The system prompt forbids a second separator and the per-turn reminder repeats it, but a prompt bounds frequency, not damage. The guard bounds damage.

Only a *bare* separator counts — the marker alone on its line, after stripping. An inline mention in prose (`the 🟨🟨🟨 REPL separator divides the sections`) is legitimate content; this repository's own specs and prompt files quote the markers in running text and fenced examples, and must stay editable.

## Failure Diagnostics

- Anchor not found — old text doesn't match any location
- Malformed block — new text carries a stray separator line
- Ambiguous anchor — old text matches multiple locations
- Whitespace mismatch — tabs vs spaces, trailing whitespace detected as a likely cause

## Application Modes

- Dry run — validate all blocks, report what would change, no writes
- Apply — write to disk, stage modified files in git

## Per-Block Results

Status values:

- Applied — written to disk
- Already applied — new content already present (idempotent)
- Validated — dry-run passed
- Failed — anchor not found or ambiguous
- Skipped — binary file or pre-condition failed
- Not in context — file not in active selection; edit deferred

Each result includes: file path, status, human-readable message, machine-readable error type.

## Error Type Classification

- Anchor not found
- Ambiguous anchor
- File not found
- Write error — validated but disk write failed
- Validation error — path traversal blocked, binary file

## Not-In-Context Edit Handling

- Separate edit blocks into in-context and not-in-context groups
- Apply in-context edits normally
- Mark not-in-context edits with special status, do not attempt application
- Auto-add not-in-context files to selected files list for next request
- Broadcast file change via the standard callback
- Include system note in completion result listing auto-added files

## Created File Handling

- Successful create blocks auto-add the new file to the selected files list
- Broadcast file change via the standard callback so the picker checkbox reflects the new selection
- The completion result lists created files separately from not-in-context auto-adds — the frontend distinguishes the two
- No retry prompt is generated for creates — the create already succeeded, there is nothing to retry
- Dry-run creates (validated but not written) do not auto-add — nothing was written to disk
- Failed creates (conflict with an existing file, write error) do not auto-add

## Auto-Populated Retry Prompts

- When not-in-context edits are detected, auto-populate chat textarea with retry prompt naming added files
- Prompt is not auto-sent — user reviews and sends when ready
- When ambiguous-anchor failures are detected, auto-populate prompt asking for more unique context
- When old-text-mismatch failures occur on in-context files, prompt asks the LLM to re-read the file content and retry
- Multiple retry prompts can collide — latter one overwrites earlier one in textarea (acceptable — user can edit)
- Created files do not generate a retry prompt — they auto-add to selection but the create already succeeded

## Why Not Auto-Retry

- Adds complexity (continuation streams, loop prevention, cost control)
- Removes user control over what is sent to the LLM
- User's natural follow-up provides context the LLM can use to improve the edit

## Detecting Context Membership

- A file is in context if it is in the current selected files list at the time edits are applied
- Files that exist on disk but are not selected are not in context — the LLM has only seen their index block

## Post-Application

- Modified files staged in git
- Symbol cache entries invalidated for modified files
- Doc index cache invalidated for modified doc files (and structure re-extracted immediately)
- File tree refreshed on client
- Results included in completion event

## Concurrent Invocation

The apply pipeline is safe to invoke concurrently for different edit-block batches. Per-file write serialization is provided by the repository layer's per-path mutex (see [repository.md](../1-foundation/repository.md#per-path-write-serialization)) — two concurrent batches targeting different files proceed in parallel; two targeting the same file serialize at the write step.

In single-agent operation, only one apply pipeline invocation runs at a time. The re-entrancy guarantee exists so a future parallel-agent mode (see [parallel-agents.md](../7-future/parallel-agents.md)) can invoke the pipeline from N threads concurrently without refactoring. The anchor-based validation model already handles the failure case naturally — if two agents' edits target overlapping text, one succeeds and the other fails with an ambiguous-anchor or anchor-not-found diagnostic, which feeds into the assessment step.

## Review Mode Read-Only

- Review mode skips all edit application entirely
- Edit blocks still appear in the response for reference but are not applied to disk
- Applies to the whole streaming pipeline — the edit parser runs but the apply step is a no-op

## Partial Failure

- Edits applied sequentially — earlier successes remain on disk and staged
- No rollback
- Failed edit details visible in subsequent exchanges so the LLM can retry with corrected content

## Shell Command Detection

- Assistant responses scanned for shell commands for UI display
- Detected in fenced code blocks with `bash` / `shell` / `sh` language tags, lines prefixed with `$ `, or lines prefixed with `> ` (unless starting with common prose words)
- Returned as a list for display; not executed automatically

## Invariants

- An anchor that matches zero or multiple locations always fails; never silently applied
- Create blocks (empty old section) are always attempted regardless of context membership
- Successful create blocks always auto-add the new file to the selected files list
- Auto-added files from not-in-context modifies and from creates are tracked separately in the completion result; only not-in-context modifies drive retry prompts
- File modifications are confined to files within the repository root
- A failed edit never partially writes — the file is left unchanged
- Sequential edits on the same file preserve the order in which the LLM produced them
- The apply pipeline is safe to invoke concurrently for different edit-block batches; per-file writes serialize via the repository's per-path mutex
