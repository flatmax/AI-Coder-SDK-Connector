# Search

Search is integrated into the Files tab's chat panel action bar rather than occupying a separate tab. A mode toggle switches between chat message search and file content search. File search shows a match overlay covering the messages area and a pruned file tree in the picker, with bidirectional scroll sync between them.

## Action Bar Integration

The search area shares the chat panel's action bar with session buttons. It consists of:

- Segmented mode control (💬 messages / 📁 files) on the left of the input — both buttons always visible when the search bar has focus; active mode highlighted with the accent halo treatment used by the code/doc primary-mode toggle. Clicking the inactive button switches modes; clicking the active button refocuses the input rather than toggling, since modes are mutually exclusive and re-clicking the active mode shouldn't change anything
- Search input with inline toggle buttons on the right edge (ignore case, regex, whole word)
- Match counter showing current position or total count
- Navigation arrows (previous / next)
- Session buttons (new session, history browser) — hidden when file search is active

The input and its inline toggles share a single border. Focus-within highlights the border.

When the search bar does not have focus, every affordance except the input itself collapses — segmented control, option toggles, counter, and nav arrows all hide via CSS (`.search-bar:not(:focus-within)`). The placeholder text (`Search messages…` or `Search files…`) indicates the active mode in the resting state. Clicking the input restores the full toolbar via the symmetric `:focus-within` rule. The collapsed rest state matches the intent of the action-bar `.search-collapsible` pattern: when the user is searching, search dominates the row; when they aren't, search yields its space to neighbouring controls.

## Dual Mode

### Message Search (Default)

- Matches against raw message content strings (not rendered HTML)
- Ignore-case toggle affects case sensitivity
- Match counter shows current index and total count
- All messages remain visible — matches are highlighted and scrolled into view
- Current match scrolled to center with accent-bordered highlight and subtle glow
- Previous/next buttons or Enter/Shift+Enter cycle through matches, wrapping around
- Escape clears the query and blurs the input

### File Search

- Debounced content search via the repo's search RPC with the three toggle flags
- Results appear in an overlay covering the messages area
- File picker swaps to a pruned tree showing only matching files
- Bidirectional scroll sync between overlay and picker
- Sending a chat message auto-exits file search mode

## Inline Toggles

Three toggle buttons inside the input's right edge:

- Ignore case — default on
- Regex — default off; when on, the query is interpreted as a regular expression
- Whole word — default off; when on, only whole-word matches count

Toggle states persisted to localStorage under individual keys. Applied to both message and file search modes. Active toggles use the same accent halo treatment (background tint, 1px ring, soft outer halo) as the segmented mode control — keeping the visual language consistent across every icon-only button in the action bar (see [file-picker.md § Active-State Halo](file-picker.md#active-state-halo) for the shared rule).

## File Search Overlay

When file search mode is active:

- The messages area is hidden (CSS display, not removed from DOM)
- The overlay is shown in the same space (absolutely positioned)
- The chat input remains visible below the overlay
- Chat panel DOM state (streaming, scroll position, input text) is preserved

### Result Display

Results grouped by file:

- File header — sticky, shows path and match count badge; clicking opens the file in the diff viewer
- Match rows — line number + highlighted text; clicking opens the file at that line
- Context rows — one line before and after each match, dimmed, not clickable

Match text highlighted using a regex built from the query respecting the current toggle states.

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Enter | Navigate to focused match (open in diff viewer) |
| Shift+Enter | Previous match |
| Up / Down | Move focus through matches |
| Escape | Clear query first; on second press, exit file search mode |

The focused match has a distinct visual treatment (accent left border, background highlight).

### Empty States

- Query empty — "Type to search across files"
- No results — "No results found"

## Pruned Tree

After each search, the files tab builds a pruned tree from the results:

1. Split each matching file path on separator, insert into a nested directory structure
2. Set each file node's line-count field to the match count (not the real line count) — picker renders this as a badge identically
3. Call the picker's set-tree method to inject the tree, bypassing the normal tree load RPC
4. Picker auto-expands all directories

When file search exits, the full tree is restored. Expand state from before the search is preserved and restored (see [file-picker.md](file-picker.md#file-search-integration)).

## Bidirectional Scroll Sync

### Overlay → Picker

- As the user scrolls through results, the chat panel detects which file section is at the top of the visible area
- Dispatches a search-scroll event with the file path
- Files tab updates the picker's focused path, auto-expands ancestor directories, and scrolls the picker row into view

### Picker → Overlay

- Clicking a file in the pruned tree during file search mode is intercepted by the files tab (file-clicked event)
- Instead of navigating to the diff viewer, the files tab calls the chat panel's scroll-to-file method
- Chat panel smooth-scrolls the overlay to the target file section
- A brief pause flag prevents feedback loops between the two directions

## Activation

File search mode can be activated by:

- Clicking the 📁 button in the segmented mode control — only switches when not already in file mode; otherwise refocuses the input
- Pressing Ctrl+Shift+F — routed through the dialog → files tab → chat panel's activate method
- Calling the activate method programmatically, which optionally prefills the query from a text selection

Ctrl+Shift+F captures `window.getSelection()` synchronously before focus changes clear it. Multi-line selections are ignored. The dialog switches to the Files tab and activates file search mode. See [shell.md](shell.md#ctrlshiftf-selection-capture) for the timing rules.

## Component Architecture

Split across three components:

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Chat panel | Search UI (toggle buttons, input, overlay), file search RPC, match rendering, scroll sync events |
| Files tab | Listens for search-changed and search-scroll events, builds pruned tree, intercepts picker clicks during search |
| File picker | Renders pruned tree via set-tree, normal tree via load-tree |

## Stale Response Discarding

- A generation counter on the search RPC call discards stale responses when new searches are issued before previous ones complete
- Prevents older results from overwriting newer ones when the user types rapidly

## Message Search Highlight Implementation

- Message cards have a transparent border by default with a CSS transition on border color and box shadow
- A highlight class (applied via message-index attribute matching) sets an accent border and subtle glow
- Chat panel manages highlight state internally — scroll-to-match method clears all previous highlights, then queries its own shadow DOM for the matching card and applies the class
- Uses scroll-into-view with block center alignment to bring the match into view
- All highlight state (matches array, current index) is managed within the chat panel

## Exit Behavior

- Explicit toggle back to message search — clear file search state, restore full tree
- Escape twice — same
- Send chat message — auto-exit, restore full tree, clear pruned state
- Switching dialog tabs — file search state is preserved (overlay stays hidden via tab switch, ready to show on return)

## Invariants

- Search mode state (message vs file) is always reflected by the mode toggle button
- Inline toggle states always persist across sessions via localStorage
- File search overlay never destroys chat panel DOM state — streaming, scroll, and input state survive toggling
- Pruned tree is always replaced by the full tree on file search exit
- Expand state from before file search is always restored on exit
- Message search highlights are always cleared before applying a new highlight
- Ctrl+Shift+F selection capture is synchronous in the keydown handler; never re-read inside async callbacks
- Bidirectional scroll sync never enters a feedback loop — a brief pause flag guards each direction
- Stale search responses (from rapid typing) are never applied — a generation counter discards them
- Sending a chat message always auto-exits file search mode and restores the full tree
