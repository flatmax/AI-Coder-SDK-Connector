# Streaming Lifecycle

The full lifecycle of a user message: UI submission → file validation → message assembly → LLM streaming → edit parsing → stability tracking → post-response compaction.

## Request Flow

- Browser shows user message immediately
- Browser generates a request ID for callback correlation
- Browser calls streaming RPC; server returns synchronously with started status
- Server launches background streaming task
- Stream chunks and events delivered via server-push callbacks

## Server Guards

- Reject if server is still initializing (deferred init not complete)
- Reject if another **user-initiated** stream is active (single user-initiated stream policy)
- Capture main event loop reference on the RPC entry thread, before launching background task

### Multiple Agent Streams Under a Parent Request

The single-stream guard gates user-initiated requests, not internal streams. A future parallel-agent mode (see [parallel-agents.md](../7-future/parallel-agents.md)) spawns N internal LLM streams under a single user-initiated request. These internal streams share the parent's request ID as a prefix and are distinguished by child IDs (e.g. `{parent-id}-agent-0`). The guard does not block them because they are not user-initiated — they are internal machinery serving one user intent.

Request IDs are the multiplexing primitive. All server-push events carry the exact ID of the stream they belong to. The transport never assumes a singleton stream.

### Stream Resumption After Reconnect

The server-side stream lifecycle is independent of the websocket transport. When the originating browser disconnects (refresh, network drop, tab swap), the worker thread keeps running the LLM call; chunks accumulate server-side; cleanup happens when the call completes naturally. A reconnecting client must be able to re-attach to its own in-flight stream rather than seeing the opaque single-stream-guard rejection.

The mechanism extends Passive Stream Adoption (below) to cover the originating client. Two pieces of state make this possible:

- A reverse map `_active_request_to_agent: dict[str, str | None]` keyed by request ID, valued by the owning agent ID (or `None` for the main scope). Populated alongside the single-stream guard in `chat_streaming`; cleared in the streaming pipeline's `finally` block.
- The existing per-request accumulator `_request_accumulators: dict[str, str]` populated by the worker thread on every chunk.

The `get_current_state` RPC's response carries an `active_streams` field — one entry per in-flight stream, each entry containing the request ID, owning agent ID (or null for main), and the accumulated content so far. The frontend's `state-loaded` handler consumes the field, resolves each entry to its tab, and re-attaches: stamps `currentRequestId`, sets `streaming=true`, installs `accumulated_content` as `streamingContent`. Subsequent chunks broadcast on the same request ID then route through the existing chunk-routing path. The next `streamComplete` finalizes the message normally.

Race window: a user who sends a new message before `state-loaded` resolves still sees the single-stream-guard rejection. The frontend augments the rejection toast with guidance to wait for resume or start a new session — small UX patch for a narrow timing window.

## Background Task Overview

- Remove deselected files from context
- Validate files — reject binary and missing, actively remove deleted files from file context
- Load files into context
- Re-index symbol or doc index (mtime-based; only changed files re-parsed)
- Initialize stability tracker lazily on first request (if eager init failed)
- Detect and fetch URLs from the prompt (up to a per-message limit); honour the per-turn exclusion set supplied by the client so unchecked URLs are absent from the prompt's URL section while remaining in the session-scoped fetched dict for later re-inclusion
- Persist user message to JSONL and add to in-memory context before streaming begins
- Broadcast user message to all clients
- Build and inject review context when review mode is active
- Append system reminder to user prompt
- Build tiered content from stability tracker
- Assemble tiered message array with cache-control markers — the aggregate symbol/doc map in L0 contains every indexed file (only user-excluded files filtered)
- Run LLM completion in a worker thread, streaming
- Add assistant response to context after stream completes
- Save symbol map to per-repo working directory
- Print terminal HUD
- Parse and apply edit blocks
- Persist assistant message
- Send completion event (`streamComplete`) — fires immediately so the chat panel can finalise the response without waiting for downstream housekeeping
- Update cache stability
- Run post-response compaction
- Launch deferred doc enrichment (if any)
- Send post-response complete event (`postResponseComplete`) — fires after tier state and compaction have settled, signalling that the breakdown RPC will now return consistent data

## Aggregate Map Rendering

Under the L0-content-typed model, the symbol map (code mode) or doc map (document mode) in L0's system message contains every indexed file's block. Selected files appear in the map AND as full text in a lower tier — that's the design. The system prompt's authority rule instructs the LLM to treat full text in Working Files as canonical when it disagrees with the structural map. The only filter applied at map-render time is the user's index-exclusion set (file picker's three-state checkbox), since excluded files have no representation in the prompt at all.

## Cache Warmer Coordination

A background cache warmer (see [cache-tiering.md § Cache Warmer](cache-tiering.md#cache-warmer)) issues periodic minimal LLM calls during idle periods to keep the provider's prompt cache hot. The streaming pipeline coordinates with it at two points:

- At the top of `stream_chat`: cancel any pending warm-up. A real LLM request is about to fly; the warmer should not race it. Pending countdowns close via the `cacheWarmupCancelled` broadcast (frontend dismisses the progress bar).
- At the end of `stream_chat`: reset the warmer. User activity just completed; restart the idle timer.
- The warmer broadcasts four events to the browser via the standard `_event_callback` channel: `cacheWarmupCountdown`, `cacheWarmupFiring`, `cacheWarmupComplete`, `cacheWarmupCancelled`. See [streaming reference](../../specs-reference/3-llm/streaming.md) for payload schemas.

The warmer never registers itself in the single-stream guard — its existence is invisible to `chat_streaming`. Real user requests fire regardless of whether a warm-up is mid-flight.

## File Context Sync

- Compare current file context against incoming selected files list
- Remove files present in context but absent from new selection
- Actively remove deleted files (distinct from selection changes)
- Ensures deselected or deleted files don't linger in in-memory context across requests

## Deferred Initialization Guard

- Service supports deferred init mode — skips stability init at construction
- Init-complete flag gates streaming — requests arriving before init completes are rejected with a user-friendly message
- Flag is set after deferred-init completion

## Session Totals Tracking

- Service maintains cumulative token usage across all requests in the current server session
- Input, output, cache-read, cache-write tokens accumulated from each per-request usage dict
- Reported in context breakdown and terminal HUD

## Session Restore Timing

- Last session restored eagerly before the WebSocket server starts accepting connections
- Ensures first browser connect returns previous session messages without waiting for deferred init
- Deferred-init completion handles only symbol index wiring, does not re-run session restore

## Stability Tracker Initialization

- Eager path — initialization during deferred startup phase (index repo, build reference graph, initialize tier assignments, seed L0, print startup HUD)
- Progress reported to the browser via startup-progress events
- Fallback lazy path — on first chat request if eager init failed (e.g., no symbol index or repo)
- Once initialized by either path, the stability-initialized flag prevents re-initialization
- Lazy path also seeds system prompt into L0 after re-indexing so the legend reflects final content

## Client-Side Initiation

- Guard — skip if empty input
- Exit file search mode if active (restore full tree, clear query)
- Reset scroll — re-enable auto-scroll
- Build URL context — get included fetched URLs, append to LLM message (not shown in UI)
- Show user message immediately
- Clear input, images, detected URLs, close snippet drawer
- Generate request ID — timestamp + random suffix
- Track request — store current request ID
- Set streaming state (disable input)
- Call streaming RPC

## LLM Streaming (Worker Thread)

- Runs in a thread pool to avoid blocking the async event loop
- Call provider with streaming, usage reporting, and an explicit `max_tokens` ceiling
- For each chunk — accumulate text, fire chunk callback
- Check cancellation flag each iteration
- Track token usage from the final chunk
- Capture `finish_reason` from whichever chunk first reports a non-null value (typically the final chunk)
- Return accumulated content, cancelled flag, and finish reason

### Max-Tokens Resolution

Every `litellm.completion()` call — streaming chat, commit message generation, topic detection — passes an explicit `max_tokens` argument. Resolution is a two-level fallback chain:

1. `config.max_output_tokens` — user override in `llm.json` (optional)
2. `counter.max_output_tokens` — per-model ceiling from `TokenCounter`

The user override is clamped against the counter ceiling — a config value larger than the provider supports is capped rather than passed through (which would produce a 400). Without the explicit argument, providers apply their own default (commonly 4096), silently truncating long responses — edit-heavy assistant turns routinely exceed 4096 tokens and would be cut mid-edit-block.

### Finish Reason

The provider reports `finish_reason` on the final chunk (earlier chunks report None). Normalized values via litellm:

- `stop`, `end_turn` — natural end of generation
- `length` — hit `max_tokens`; response truncated
- `content_filter` — safety filter triggered
- `tool_calls`, `function_call` — model requesting a tool

The worker captures whichever chunk first reports a non-null value and propagates it through the stream-complete result. Natural stops log at INFO; non-natural stops log at WARNING so operators can diagnose truncation without trawling debug logs.

### Retry Policy

LiteLLM's built-in `num_retries=` kwarg uses a tenacity policy with a short fixed delay and doesn't treat provider-specific rate-limit errors as retryable on all providers (Bedrock 429s in particular fall through on some LiteLLM versions). AC⚡DC wraps every `litellm.completion(...)` call in its own retry loop with explicit exponential backoff:

- Retries the call up to `num_retries` times on transient error types — rate_limit, api_connection, service_unavailable, timeout. Non-transient types (authentication, bad_request, context_window_exceeded, not_found) fail immediately without retry.
- Exponential backoff with jitter between attempts. Per-attempt wait is capped at a ceiling (60 seconds) to keep the total retry budget bounded on long runs of 429s.
- Honours the `Retry-After` header when the provider supplies one. When the header value exceeds the computed exponential wait, the header value wins — Bedrock sometimes hands back 30-60s retry hints that would otherwise be under-respected by the exponential schedule alone.

The outer retry replaces LiteLLM's `num_retries=` kwarg at every call site — stacking both would multiply waits and mask provider retry hints. The three call sites that use it:

- Streaming completion — retry applies only to stream establishment. Once chunks start flowing, a mid-stream failure can't be replayed because partial content has already been delivered to the UI. The 429 pattern this protects against raises before any chunk arrives, so the retry catches it cleanly.
- Commit-message generation — non-streaming call on the smaller model.
- Topic boundary detection — non-streaming call on the smaller model; failures still fall back to the safe default after retry exhaustion.

`num_retries` is a config field in `llm.json`, defaulting to 10. Non-positive values disable retry (single attempt). Values larger than a few dozen are pointless in practice — sustained rate-limit windows that last that long require either provider-side quota adjustment or a different model.

## Chunk Delivery Semantics

- Each chunk carries full accumulated content, not deltas
- Dropped or reordered chunks are harmless — the latest chunk contains a superset of prior content
- Reconnection is simple — no delta replay protocol needed
- O(n²) bandwidth for the stream is acceptable since chunks arrive faster than the LLM generates
- Each chunk carries the exact request ID of its stream; browser routing uses the ID to demultiplex when multiple streams are active concurrently (e.g. parallel agents)

## Worker Thread → Event Loop Bridge

- Main event loop reference captured at the RPC entry point, on the event loop thread, before launching the background task
- Worker thread uses run-coroutine-threadsafe with the captured loop to schedule callbacks
- Never acquire a new event loop inside the worker thread

## Chunk Coalescing (Frontend)

- Chunks coalesced per animation frame
- A pending-chunk variable stores the latest content; frame callback reads and clears it before updating streaming content
- Avoids re-rendering faster than 60 Hz even when chunks arrive every few milliseconds

## Passive Stream Adoption (Collaborator)

- When a chunk arrives with a request ID the client did not initiate, the client adopts the stream as passive
- Sets current request ID to the incoming ID
- Sets passive-stream flag to distinguish from self-initiated streams
- Processes subsequent chunks normally
- On completion of a passive stream, the user message from the result is prepended before the assistant response (since the passive client didn't add it optimistically)

## Cancellation

- During streaming, Send button transforms into Stop
- Clicking calls cancel-streaming RPC
- Server adds request ID to cancelled set; streaming thread checks each iteration and breaks out
- Partial content stored with marker; completion event sent with cancelled flag

## Agents Spawned Event

When a user turn's main-LLM response contains valid agent-spawn blocks AND the `agents.enabled` config toggle is on, the backend fires an `agentsSpawned` server-push event immediately after parsing the main response and BEFORE invoking the agent-gather step. Payload: `{turn_id, parent_request_id, agent_blocks: [{id, task, agent_idx}, ...]}`.

Ordering is load-bearing. Agent child streams begin as soon as the spawn step dispatches them; without `agentsSpawned` firing first, a fast-completing agent can finish its entire stream before the main `streamComplete` arrives carrying `agent_blocks` in its result dict — and the frontend's tab-lookup logic silently drops every chunk whose request ID doesn't match an existing tab's current request. Firing `agentsSpawned` between response parse and agent dispatch lets the frontend create the tabs and seed their child request IDs before any child chunk reaches the chunk handler.

Child request IDs follow the format `{parent_request_id}-agent-{NN:02d}` where NN is the zero-padded agent index. Archive files use the same NN convention (`{turn_id}/agent-NN.jsonl`). Tab identity is decoupled from this index — tab ids are the agent's LLM-chosen id from its spawn block — so the frontend's `_findTabForRequest` matches the child request ID against each tab's stored `currentRequestId` rather than reconstructing the tab id from the index.

Tabs created from `agentsSpawned` are idempotent with the spawn-from-`streamComplete` fallback path: the frontend's tab creation short-circuits when a tab for the same agent id already exists, so an older backend that only surfaces `agent_blocks` via `streamComplete` continues to work (tabs appear after all agents finish, as before — child chunks still dropped, but the final transcripts become visible via the archive).

## Stream Completion Result

- Full assistant response text
- Token usage (prompt, completion, cache read, cache write)
- Finish reason from the provider's final chunk (may be None if the stream raised or no chunk reported one)
- Parsed edit blocks with create flags
- Detected shell command suggestions
- Aggregate edit status counts (passed, already-applied, failed, skipped, not-in-context)
- Modified file paths
- Per-edit detailed results
- Files auto-added for not-in-context edits
- Original user message text (for collaborator sync)
- Cancelled flag (if cancelled)
- Error field (if fatal error)
- Binary/invalid files rejected

## Two Completion Events

The pipeline fires two distinct events for each successful turn — `streamComplete` and `postResponseComplete` — with different timing semantics and different consumers.

| Event | Fires when | Carries | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `streamComplete` | Immediately after the LLM call returns and edit application completes | Full assistant response, edit results, finish reason, token usage, agent blocks | Chat panel — finalises the streaming message in the UI without waiting for tracker update or compaction |
| `postResponseComplete` | After `_post_response` finishes (stability tracker update, compaction, terminal HUD) | Just the request ID | Context tab — refetches `get_context_breakdown` knowing tier state is now consistent |

The split exists because the chat panel and the Context tab have opposing latency requirements. The chat panel wants its UI to flip from streaming to complete the moment the LLM stops generating — even a 100ms delay reads as sluggish. The Context tab wants its tier display to match the actual post-response tracker state — refetching during the brief window between `streamComplete` and `_update_stability` returns pre-update data and the user has to manually refresh.

Firing both events lets each consumer pick the right signal:

- The chat panel listens to `streamComplete` and ignores `postResponseComplete`.
- The Context tab listens to `postResponseComplete` for authoritative refreshes (and also `streamComplete` for partial-data updates that don't depend on tracker state).
- The Token HUD listens to `streamComplete` because its data comes from the completion result itself, not from the tracker.

When a Context tab subscriber receives both events for the same turn (because it also listens to `streamComplete` for non-tracker reasons), the in-flight refresh queue collapses them into "first fetch + one queued fetch" — the queued fetch reads the post-update state. See [viewers-hud.md § Refresh Queue](../5-webapp/viewers-hud.md#refresh-queue).

## Client Processing of Completion

- Flush pending chunks
- Clear streaming state
- Handle errors — show error as assistant message with error prefix
- Finalize message — build edit results map keyed by file path, attach aggregate counts
- Clear streaming content buffer
- Scroll to bottom if auto-scroll engaged (double animation-frame wait for layout)
- Refresh file tree if modified files present
- Refresh repo file list for file mention detection of newly created files
- Check for ambiguous anchor failures — auto-populate retry prompt
- Check for old-text-mismatch failures on in-context files — auto-populate retry prompt

## URL Fetch Notifications During Streaming

- Already-fetched URLs skipped without notification
- Fetch-start — transient toast showing URL display name
- Fetch-ready — success toast
- URL context set on context manager as a pre-joined string

## Post-Response Processing — Stability Update

- Build active items list from selected files, index entries for all indexed non-selected files, cross-reference items (when enabled), history messages
- Remove user-excluded items from tracker before update cycle
- Run tracker update phases
- Log tier changes (promotions and demotions)

## Post-Response Processing — Compaction

- Runs asynchronously after completion event, with a short delay
- Send compaction-start notification via event callback
- Check if history exceeds trigger
- Run compaction if needed
- Re-register history items in stability tracker
- Send compaction-complete (or error) notification

## Deferred Doc Enrichment

- When edit blocks modify document files, structures are re-extracted immediately but keyword enrichment is deferred
- Prevents CPU-bound enrichment from blocking the WebSocket write that transitions the UI from stop to send mode
- Enrichment queue stashed in completion result under a private key, stripped before the event is sent (outline objects aren't JSON-serializable)
- After completion event and an event-loop yield to flush the WebSocket frame, enrichment launched in the background

## Commit Background Task Guard

- Commit-all uses a boolean guard to prevent concurrent commits
- Guard set true before launching background task, cleared in a finally block
- Session ID captured synchronously before launching the background task — prevents a race where a concurrent server restart replaces the session ID, causing the commit event to persist to the wrong session
- Session-scoped mutable state must be captured as local variables at task-launch time, passed as parameters, never read from instance attrs inside the task

## Commit-Message Generation Failure

Commit-message generation runs the smaller model as a non-streaming call inside the background task. It can fail like any other LLM call — and one failure mode is routine rather than exceptional: the staged diff exceeds the smaller model's context window (`context_window_exceeded`). A wholesale commit of a large working tree easily pushes the diff past a small model's 200k-token limit.

The failure must always reach the user. The pipeline returns immediately with a started status, so the synchronous RPC return cannot carry the outcome — the error only travels via the `commitResult` broadcast. If that broadcast is silent or unhandled, the commit button quietly re-enables and the user sees nothing despite a logged warning. This is the contract that prevents that:

- `generate_commit_message` resets a single-slot error field on the service at the start of every call, and on failure stores the classified error dict there (same shape and `error_type` vocabulary as the streaming path's error-info slot — see [Retry Policy](#retry-policy)). A successful call leaves the slot cleared, so a stale error from a prior commit never leaks into a later success. The slot is kept distinct from the streaming error-info slot so a background commit can't clobber an in-flight completion's error.
- On a `None` return, the background task reads the slot and broadcasts `commitResult` with **both** a human-readable `error` string **and** the structured `error_info` dict — mirroring the streaming completion result's error fields so the frontend has one consistent shape to dispatch on.
- The `error` string is tailored off `error_type` rather than always saying "could not reach the model". For `context_window_exceeded` it points at the diff size and suggests committing fewer files or configuring a larger-context smaller model — telling the user to "check your network connection" when the model was reached and rejected an oversized prompt sends them down the wrong path. Authentication, rate-limit, and not-found errors get their own tailored wording; everything else falls back to the generic "could not reach the model" message. Every variant ends by noting the staged changes are unchanged.
- A generation failure never commits a fallback message. The user clicked commit expecting a real generated message; silently committing "chore: update files" would hide the failure.

Frontend consumption of this broadcast is specified in [chat.md § Commit (Server-Driven)](../5-webapp/chat.md#commit-server-driven).

## Token Usage Extraction

- Extracted from the provider's response
- Different providers report cache tokens under different field names — extraction uses a dual-mode getter with fallback chains
- Stream-level usage captured from any chunk with it (typically the final chunk)
- Response-level usage merged as fallback
- Completion tokens estimated from content length only if the provider reported no completion count

## Terminal HUD

Three reports printed after each response:

- Cache blocks (boxed) — per-tier token counts and cache-hit percentage, with sub-item summaries
- Token usage — model, per-category breakdown, total, last-request in/out, cache read/write, session total
- Tier changes — promotions and demotions logged by the stability tracker

## Error Handling

- Invalid/binary files — completion event with error, client auto-deselects
- Concurrent stream — rejected immediately
- Streaming exception — caught, traceback printed, completion event with error
- History token emergency — oldest messages truncated if history exceeds 2× compaction trigger
- Budget exceeded — largest files shed with warning

## Invariants

- Only one user-initiated stream at a time; internal agent streams may coexist under a parent request ID
- All server-push events carry the exact request ID of the stream they belong to — the transport never assumes a singleton stream
- User message is persisted before LLM call begins — mid-stream crashes preserve user intent
- Assistant message is persisted after LLM call completes — no partial assistant messages in history
- The captured event loop reference is always usable from the worker thread
- The aggregate symbol/doc map in L0 contains every indexed file's block (minus user-excluded paths); duplication with full text in lower tiers is the intended design and is resolved at LLM read time by the system prompt's authority rule
- `streamComplete` always fires before `postResponseComplete` for the same turn; `postResponseComplete` fires only on successful (non-cancelled, non-errored) turns where post-response housekeeping actually runs
- Tier-state-dependent UI (Context tab, Token HUD's tier section) reads its authoritative state from `postResponseComplete`, not `streamComplete`; reading from `streamComplete` returns pre-update tracker data because the broadcast races `_update_stability`
