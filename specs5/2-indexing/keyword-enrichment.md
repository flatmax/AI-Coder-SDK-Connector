# Keyword Enrichment

Keyword extraction for document outlines. Disambiguates sections with similar heading structures by surfacing what each section is actually about.

## Motivation

- Structural extraction alone is insufficient when heading text is generic or repeated
- API references, spec suites, compliance checklists, template-based reports share subheading patterns across sections
- Semantic keywords per section let the LLM distinguish between structurally identical sections
- SVG prose blocks (text elements exceeding the label-length threshold — see [document-index.md § Long Text Elements](document-index.md#long-text-elements--prose-blocks-for-enrichment)) flow through the same pipeline as markdown sections

## Underlying Technique

- Sentence-transformer embeddings used to find keywords most semantically similar to a text chunk
- Ranked keywords with relevance scores returned per section
- Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) applied to reduce near-duplicate keywords
- Diversity parameter controls MMR penalty strength — pushes keywords apart in embedding space

## Pipeline

- Structural extraction produces an outline with headings, links, and raw section text (or prose blocks for SVG)
- Enricher receives the outline and the full document text
- Eligible sections (above minimum character threshold) are collected into a batch — markdown sections and SVG prose blocks are mixed into the same batch when both are present in a single document
- Batched extraction — all sections encoded in one forward pass for speed
- Keywords attached to their respective headings or prose blocks
- Per-document TF-IDF corpus includes all eligible text from the document regardless of source (markdown sections and SVG prose blocks share the corpus), so contrastive scoring works uniformly

## Configuration Surface

- Sentence-transformer model name
- Enabled flag
- Keywords per section (top-N)
- N-gram range (unigrams and bigrams by default)
- Minimum section character count
- Minimum relevance score
- Diversity parameter
- TF-IDF fallback threshold (character count)
- Maximum document frequency (corpus-aware filter)

## Quality Improvements

### Content-Type Hints

- Content patterns detected during extraction — table, code, formula
- Annotated inline after keywords
- Helps LLM know a section contains reference material without loading it

### Section Size Signal

- Line count from heading to next heading
- Sections under threshold have size annotation omitted
- Helps LLM budget file-loading decisions

### TF-IDF Fallback for Short Sections

- Sections below character threshold use TF-IDF instead of embedding-based extraction
- Vectorizer fit on all section texts in the document as the corpus
- Surfaces terms distinctive to the short section relative to its siblings
- Embeddings tend to select generic terms for short passages; TF-IDF penalizes corpus-wide frequency

### Code Stripping

- Fenced code blocks and inline code spans stripped before passing to the model
- Keeps keyword extraction focused on explanatory prose
- Sections that become empty after stripping fall back to unstripped text

### Corpus-Aware Stopwords

- After extraction, keywords that appear in more than a threshold fraction of sections are filtered
- Removes pervasive domain terms that don't disambiguate
- Document frequency computed once per batch
- A bigram is filtered only if all its constituent unigrams exceed the threshold
- If pruning would leave a section keyword-less, the top keyword is retained regardless

### Adaptive Top-N

- Large sections get extra keywords to capture vocabulary from multiple branches
- Modest token cost for multi-pathway logic sections

### Hard Upper Bound on Section Size

- Sections and prose blocks above a configurable character limit are skipped before extraction
- Sentence-transformer models truncate input at 512 tokens (~2KB) regardless of input size — feeding megabyte-scale blobs wastes memory in numpy/torch intermediate buffers without improving the result
- The MMR cosine-similarity step in particular allocates buffers proportional to input length and can trigger OOM kills on pathologically large inputs (e.g., PyMuPDF SVG exports that inline an entire PDF page as one text element)
- Skipped units retain their structural outline entries; only the `keywords` list stays empty
- A warning is logged identifying the file, the unit's size, and the limit
- Default cap is 50KB — generous for any realistic markdown section, two orders of magnitude below the OOM threshold observed in the field

## Lazy Model Loading

- Model is loaded on first enrich call or first availability check
- Tristate flag (unchecked, available, unavailable) prevents re-initialization attempts
- Missing library — log warning, emit headings without keywords
- Model initialized once, reused across all files in an indexing run

## Model Cache Probing

- Before loading, probe the local model cache to determine if download is needed
- Distinct progress message for downloading vs loading from cache
- Probe failure is non-critical — fall back to generic loading message

## Packaged Release Degradation

- Release binaries may not bundle the keyword library or its dependencies (large footprint)
- Document mode remains fully functional without keywords
- Structural outlines, cross-references, reference counting, cache tiering, and doc system prompt all work
- Mode-switch response indicates availability; frontend shows a one-time warning toast
- Users running from source can install the optional extra

## Per-File Asynchronous Processing

- Background enrichment splits work into per-file executor calls
- Event loop yield between files allows WebSocket traffic to flow
- Threaded cache writes overlap disk I/O with the next file's extraction
- Model itself is not run in threads (GIL, memory footprint)

## Eager Pre-Initialization

- Model is eagerly loaded during the background startup phase before the doc-index-ready signal
- Ensures the first mode switch never blocks on a multi-second model load
- Loads unconditionally, even when all files are cached — a future file change may require enrichment

## Cache Entry Replacement

- When enrichment completes for a file, the enriched outline replaces the unenriched entry in both memory and on disk
- Replacement is atomic from the perspective of subsequent cache lookups
- The formatted output map is updated in-place so immediate queries reflect enriched content
- No stability tracker demotion on enrichment — the content hash will change, triggering a normal demote/re-graduate, which is acceptable

## Reference Index Rebuild After Enrichment

- After a batch of files completes, the reference index is rebuilt
- Defensive — keyword enrichment does not change heading or link structure in practice
- Rebuild is a no-op in terms of graph topology

## Invariants

- Keywords are always included on eligible headings (consistent formatting)
- Enrichment never blocks any user-facing operation
- Enriched outlines are cached on disk and survive server restart
- Model name mismatch invalidates cache entries
