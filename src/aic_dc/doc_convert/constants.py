"""Shared constants for the doc_convert pipelines.

Extracted from the original monolithic ``doc_convert.py`` during
the package split. Every constant defined here is referenced by
one or more of the pipeline modules (markitdown, xlsx, pptx,
libreoffice, pymupdf) and by the orchestrator. Keeping them in
one place avoids circular imports between the pipeline modules
and ensures a single source of truth — for example, the list
of "ignorable" near-white fills used by the xlsx pipeline lives
here so future tweaks don't need to be mirrored across files.

The leading-underscore naming is preserved verbatim from the
original module: these were module-private in the monolith and
remain module-private to the package. Pipeline modules import
them directly via ``from .constants import _FOO``.
