            Names follow `{stem}_img{N}{ext}` so repeated

        stem:
            Source file stem for naming extracted images
            (e.g. `architecture` → `architecture_img1.png`).
        start_index:
            First image counter value. DOCX callers pass
            ``len(zip_extracted) + 1`` so data-URI images
            numbered after the zip-extracted images and
