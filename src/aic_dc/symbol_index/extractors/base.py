"""Base class for language-specific symbol extractors.

Design notes:

- **Thin base** — plumbing only. Text decoding, range conversion,
  tree walking. No per-node-type dispatch; each subclass handles
  its own AST shape. Shared semantic helpers can graduate here
  later when a pattern genuinely appears in 3+ languages.

- **``tree_optional``** — when True, the extractor runs without
  a parse tree. Used by the (deferred) MATLAB extractor which
  has no maintained tree-sitter grammar. The orchestrator checks
  this flag before requiring a tree; default False means "needs
  tree-sitter".

- **Byte-oriented** — the API takes raw bytes because that's
  what tree-sitter produces. Extractors decode on demand via
  ``_node_text``. Invalid UTF-8 bytes are replaced rather than
  raised (matches the parser's tolerant behaviour).

- **0-indexed ranges** — matches tree-sitter's native convention.
  Callers presenting line numbers to users add 1 at the UI
  boundary. Consistency with :class:`~aic_dc.symbol_index.models.Symbol.range`.

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/symbol-index.md#per-language-extractors``.

    needs — text decoding from byte ranges, node position
    conversion, child lookup, tree traversal.

    Attributes
    ----------
    language : str
        The language name this extractor handles. Must match a
        key in :data:`~aic_dc.symbol_index.parser.LANGUAGE_MAP`
        (or be set on the subclass for tree-optional extractors
        like MATLAB). Subclasses override as a class-level
        constant.
    tree_optional : bool
        When True, the extractor runs without a parse tree. The
        orchestrator passes ``tree=None`` to such extractors.
        Default False — most languages require tree-sitter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tree
            The tree-sitter parse tree. Always non-None for normal
            extractors; None only for extractors that declare
            ``tree_optional = True``.
        source
            The raw source bytes that were parsed. Required even
            when the tree is provided — tree-sitter nodes carry
            byte offsets, not content, so the extractor needs the
            bytes to decode names and signatures.
        path
            Repo-relative file path. Stored on the returned
            :class:`FileSymbols` for downstream consumers
            (reference index, formatter).

        Returns
        -------
        FileSymbols
            The extracted symbols. Empty lists rather than None
            when nothing was found — makes callers simpler.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            Subclasses must override.
