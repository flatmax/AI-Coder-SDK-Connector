"""Tree-sitter parser — singleton with per-language lazy loading.

Design points pinned by specs3 (detail reference) and carried
forward as interop contracts:

- **Per-language grammar packages** — we consume upstream
  ``tree-sitter-{language}`` wheels rather than building grammars
  from source. Each package exposes a ``language()`` callable we
  pass to ``tree_sitter.Language(...)``.

- **TypeScript quirk** — the ``tree-sitter-typescript`` package
  is the one exception. It ships TWO grammars (TypeScript and
  TSX) and exposes ``language_typescript()`` and ``language_tsx()``
  functions — NOT a plain ``language()``. Implementers searching
  for ``language()`` on TypeScript fail silently. The loader
  probes both names.

- **Silent unavailability** — if a grammar package isn't
  installed, that language is simply unavailable. We log a debug
  message and return None. No crashes, no retries. A repo with
  Python code still indexes even if the user didn't install the
  C++ grammar.

- **Singleton** — grammar loading is expensive enough (a few ms
  per language) to cache. Tree-sitter ``Language`` and ``Parser``
  objects are thread-safe for read-only parsing use.

- **Regex-based extractors** — some languages (MATLAB) have no
  maintained tree-sitter grammar. Those declare
  ``tree_optional = True`` on their extractor class; the
  orchestrator (Layer 2.7) passes ``tree=None`` to them. This
  file knows nothing about that — extractors without a grammar
  simply don't appear in ``LANGUAGE_MAP`` here.

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/symbol-index.md#grammar-acquisition``.
