"""Cross-file reference graph for symbol-index data.

Builds a dependency graph from :class:`FileSymbols` objects and
exposes queries used by the symbol-map formatter (incoming
reference counts) and by callers asking which files cluster
together (connected components over mutual references).

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/reference-graph.md``.

Design notes:

- **Takes pre-resolved FileSymbols as input.** Call sites must
  have ``target_file`` set before the reference index is built;
  that's the import resolver's job (Layer 2.5). The index
  itself performs no resolution — it aggregates edges from
  already-resolved data.

- **Symmetric queries.** "Files that reference X" and "files X
  depends on" are equally cheap lookups. Both are needed —
  the formatter wants incoming counts, clustering wants
  connected components which need undirected edges.

- **Edges carry weight.** Multiple references from file A to
  file B (several call sites or an import plus calls) collapse
  into one weighted edge rather than being tracked
  individually. Connected-component detection doesn't care
  about weight, but :meth:`file_ref_count` does — it returns
  the total number of incoming references, not the number of
  referencing files.

- **Builtin filtering happens upstream.** Extractors already
  filter language-level builtins (``print``, ``self``, ``True``,
  test-framework hooks) from their call-site output. The
  reference index trusts that input — adding a second filter
  here would duplicate the work and make the reference graph
  inconsistent with what the extractors emitted.

- **Case-sensitive name matching.** Symbol names are matched
  exactly. Case-insensitive matching would produce false
  positives on languages where identifiers are case-sensitive
  (most of them) and mask genuine typos.

- **Plain class, not a singleton.** The orchestrator builds
  one instance per session; tests construct fresh instances
  per case. No thread-safety guarantees — callers drive the
  index from a single executor.
