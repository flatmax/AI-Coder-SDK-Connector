        Combines tracked files (``git ls-files``) with untracked
        non-ignored files (``git ls-files --others --exclude-standard``).
        Filters out paths that no longer exist on disk — git's
        index keeps tracked files in ``ls-files`` output until
        their deletion is staged with ``git rm``, so a plain
        ``rm path`` in a terminal leaves the path in the index
        listing for one or more turns. Without the on-disk
        filter, three subsystems silently feed stale paths to
        downstream consumers:

        - The file picker would list the deleted file as still
          present, and opening it would fail on read.
        - The doc-index builder's startup pass takes its file
          list from here; a tracked-but-deleted path would be
          handed to an extractor that cannot open it.
        - The ``index_repo`` pass would try to re-extract symbols
          from a path that no longer exists — defended downstream
          by the symbol index's own mtime-based pruning, but the
          spurious work is wasted.

        Flat, one per line, no tree indentation — the shape
        the index builders and the review pass want. Returns an
        empty string when the repo has no files (fresh init, no
        commits, nothing untracked) or when every listed file
        has been deleted on disk.

        Cost note: one ``Path.exists()`` (stat) per listed
        file per call. On a 5K-file repo, this is well under
        10ms. The picker's :meth:`get_file_tree` deliberately
        keeps deleted files visible with a "deleted" badge so
        the user can recover them — that path uses a different
        source set and is unaffected.
