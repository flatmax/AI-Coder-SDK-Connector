"""Repository layer.

Wraps a single git repository with file I/O, git operations, tree
listing, search, and review-mode orchestration. Exposed to the
browser via RPC and used internally by the LLM context engine.

Governing spec: ``specs4/1-foundation/repository.md``.

This package was split out of a single ``repo.py`` module. Each
sub-module contributes a mixin class holding a coherent group of
methods; ``Repo`` here composes them into the single concrete
class that the rest of the codebase imports.

The mixin layout is purely organisational — every mixin shares
the same ``self`` and the same private state (``self._root``,
``self._write_locks``, ``self._collab``, ``self._post_write_callback``)
set up in :meth:`Repo.__init__`. Method dispatch is unchanged from
the pre-split monolith.

    """Wraps a single git repository.

    Construction validates that ``repo_root`` exists, is a directory,
    and contains a ``.git`` entry (directory or file — git worktrees
    use a file). All API methods take paths relative to the repo
    root.

    Per-path write serialisation is provided by an internal lock map.
    The lock is an asyncio primitive, so write methods are ``async``.
    Read methods are synchronous — file reads don't contend and
    forcing callers to ``await`` them would add noise.
