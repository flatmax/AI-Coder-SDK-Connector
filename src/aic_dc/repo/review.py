    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Review mode uses git's soft-reset mechanism to present branch
    # changes as staged modifications. The entry sequence does a
    # specific dance of checkouts so the final state has:
    #
    #   - Disk files: at the branch tip (the code being reviewed)
    #   - Git HEAD: at the merge-base (the pre-review state)
    #   - Staged changes: everything between
    #
    # This lets the existing file picker, diff viewer, and context
    # engine work unchanged — they all already understand staged
    # changes. The full sequence is specified in
    # specs4/4-features/code-review.md.

        """Begin the review-mode entry sequence.

        Performs steps 1–5 of the entry sequence — records the
        original branch, verifies cleanliness, computes the
        merge-base, and checks out that merge-base so disk files
        reflect the pre-change state. The caller then builds the
        pre-change symbol map before invoking
        :meth:`setup_review_soft_reset` to complete the transition.

        Parameters
        ----------
        branch:
            The branch being reviewed. Can be a local branch name
            (``feature-auth``) or a remote tracking ref
            (``origin/feature-auth``).
        base_commit:
            The commit the user selected as the review base. Used
            only as a fallback when the merge-base cascade can't
            find a common ancestor between ``branch`` and a default
            branch (``main`` / ``master``).

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            On success:

            - ``branch``: the reviewed branch name
            - ``branch_tip``: full SHA of the branch tip (used by
              the exit sequence to restore)
            - ``base_commit``: the user-selected base (echoed back)
            - ``parent_commit``: the computed merge-base (current
              disk state)
            - ``original_branch``: branch HEAD was on before review,
              or ``None`` if HEAD was detached
            - ``phase``: always ``"at_parent"`` — signals the
              caller that disk is at the pre-change state and the
              pre-change symbol map should be built before the
              next step

            On failure: ``{"error": "<message>"}``. Failures include
            dirty working tree, unresolvable branch ref, and
            merge-base computation failure that also can't fall
            back to ``base_commit^``.

        """Return the diff for a single file during review mode.

        Forward direction — ``base..head`` — so additions read as
        ``+`` and removals as ``-``, matching the convention in
        commit messages, GitHub PRs, and every other diff-rendering
        tool the LLM has seen during training. Reading "what did
        this branch add" against a forward diff is one mental
        model; against a reverse diff it's two (negate the sign,
        then interpret).

        When ``base_commit`` and ``head_commit`` are both supplied,
        runs ``git diff <base> <head> -- <path>`` against the
        object database. Working tree state is irrelevant — the
        diff is the same regardless of where ``HEAD`` currently
        sits or what's staged.

        When either is missing, falls back to ``git diff --cached``,
        which during the review's soft-reset state produces the
        reverse-direction patch. Kept as a defensive fallback so
        callers that don't yet thread the SHAs through (or that
        invoke this method outside the review entry sequence)
        produce *some* diff rather than an empty string.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path:
            Relative path to the file. Must be validated and inside
            the repo root — same rules as any other path-accepting
            method.
        base_commit:
            Full SHA of the review base (the merge-base, or the
            parent of the user-selected commit). Together with
            ``head_commit`` produces a forward diff.
        head_commit:
            Full SHA of the branch tip being reviewed.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            ``{"path": "<path>", "diff": "<patch text>"}`` on success.
            Empty diff is returned as an empty string rather than an
            error — a file that's in the review but has no diff
            (e.g., only mode changes) is rare but legal.
