"""RPC transport layer.

Thin wrapper around the :mod:`jrpc_oo` library. Provides:

- Port discovery (:func:`find_available_port`)
- Event-loop reference capture (:class:`EventLoopHandle`) — the
  "capture-at-entry" contract from specs4/3-llm/streaming.md that
  worker threads must use a captured loop reference rather than
  re-acquiring one inside the worker.
- Service registration facade (:class:`RpcServer`) — composition
  over inheritance around :class:`jrpc_oo.JRPCServer`.

Governing specs: ``specs4/1-foundation/rpc-transport.md`` and
``specs4/1-foundation/jrpc-oo.md``.

    Binds each candidate port in turn and returns the first one that

    Parameters
    ----------

# jrpc-oo catches every exception a service method raises and prints one
# line — ``Failed: {e}`` or ``Async method failed: {e}`` — with no method
# name, no arguments and no timestamp (``ExposeClass.expose_all_fns``).
# A real failure therefore reaches the operator as a bare sentence like
# ``Failed: Absolute paths not accepted: /home/you/repo/a.py``, which
# names neither the call that made it nor the caller that will now render
# nothing. That is one half of ``specs5/next.md`` § C2; the browser half
# is the diff viewer treating a failed fetch as empty content.
#
# jrpc-oo is a dependency rather than vendored code, so the print stays.
# What we can do is put a properly-attributed record beside it, and the
# seam is the callback: ``add_class`` leaves a ``{name: wrapper}`` dict on
# the inner server, each wrapper takes ``(params, next_cb)``, and it
# signals failure by calling ``next_cb(error, None)``. Replacing the
# callback sees every error jrpc-oo swallows without touching the method
# itself — which matters, because service methods have Python callers too
# and wrapping *those* would log a handled ``RepoError`` as if it were a
# fault.
#
# What that costs: the exception object is gone by the time the callback
# runs, so this records the message and never a traceback. Recovering the
# traceback means intercepting where the method is called, which is the
# thing above that we are declining to do.
