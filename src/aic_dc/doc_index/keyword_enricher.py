"""Keyword enricher — Layer 2.8.4a (availability probe).

This module provides :class:`KeywordEnricher`, the entry point for
keyword extraction over :class:`~aic_dc.doc_index.models.DocOutline`
objects. It's built in three stages:

- **2.8.4a (this file, current state):** construction + availability
  probe + lazy model loading. No extraction yet — every public
  method raises or returns empty. This lets callers wire the
  enricher into the service and test the graceful-degradation
  path (KeyBERT missing) before any real extraction code lands.
- **2.8.4b:** ``enrich_outline`` — batched extraction with MMR,
  code stripping, TF-IDF fallback, corpus-aware filtering,
  adaptive top-n.
- **2.8.4c:** orchestrator integration — ``enrich_single_file``,
  ``queue_enrichment``, in-place cache entry replacement.

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/keyword-enrichment.md``.

Design notes pinned here:

- **Tristate availability flag.** ``_available`` is one of
  ``None`` (not yet probed), ``True`` (KeyBERT + sentence-
  transformers importable), ``False`` (ImportError or other
  failure during load). A missing library shows up the same
  way as a broken install — the enricher degrades to "produce
  no keywords" rather than crashing the caller.

- **Lazy model load.** The sentence-transformer model is heavy
  (200MB+ download, multi-second load). We don't load in
  ``__init__`` — only when :meth:`ensure_loaded` is called.
  The service layer (2.8.4d) calls ``ensure_loaded`` eagerly
  during the startup background phase so the first mode
  switch doesn't block on a model download.

- **Broad ImportError catch.** Matches the pattern in
  :class:`aic_dc.doc_convert.DocConvert._probe_import`. A
  module that installs but fails on import (version mismatch,
  missing native dependency, corrupted install) should show
  as unavailable rather than propagating the exception.

- **Model name is the cache key.** When the user changes the
  configured model, the enricher re-initialises with the new
  model; cached outlines with a different ``keyword_model``
  entry are refused by :meth:`DocCache.get` and trigger
  re-extraction. That machinery already exists in the doc
  cache; this module just holds the name as state for
  construction.

- **No global singleton.** The service constructs one enricher
  alongside the doc index it feeds
  (:meth:`aic_dc.claude_code.service.ClaudeCodeService._build_doc_builder`).
  Per-instance rather than module-level so the D10
  "per-context-manager scoping" contract holds if a second
  index is ever built beside the first.

           extraction.
        3. Run KeyBERT once per group with the batch of texts.
