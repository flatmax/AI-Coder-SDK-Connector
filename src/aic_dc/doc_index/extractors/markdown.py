"""Markdown extractor — regex-based outline scanner.

Line-by-line scan, no external parsing library. Produces:

- Heading tree from ATX headings (``#`` through ``######``),
  correctly nested by level transitions
- Inline links and image references via regex (standard
  markdown link syntax plus reference-style definitions)
- Content-type markers (``table``, ``code``, ``formula``) detected
  from table separator rows, fenced code blocks, and math
  delimiters
- Per-section line counts computed from adjacent heading
  positions
- Document type via filename and heading heuristics

Deliberately narrow scope:

- No CommonMark compliance. We don't care about edge cases like
  setext headings (``===`` underlines), hard-wrapped lists,
  nested blockquotes. The goal is to produce a navigation-
  friendly outline, not to render markdown.
- Reference-style link definitions are parsed and links that
  use them are resolved; undefined references fall through
  silently.
- HTML blocks pass through unchanged — any `<tag>` is just
  text to us.
- Fenced code blocks suppress heading detection inside them.
  Otherwise `#` inside a Python snippet would produce phantom
  headings.
- Inline code spans (backtick-delimited) also suppress link
  detection inside them. Otherwise a snippet like
  `` `[x](y)` `` would produce a spurious DocLink.

# pattern matches the directory name as a whole component
# rather than a coincidental prefix (e.g., "specs/" matches
# "specs/foo.md" and "sub/specs/foo.md" but not "specsnote.md").
