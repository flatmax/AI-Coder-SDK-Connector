"""SVG extractor — Layer 2.8.3e (containment-aware + prose blocks).

Builds a containment tree from shape bounding boxes and attaches
text elements to their smallest containing box. Three-level
labeling picks box headings from explicit labels, single-text
inference, or neutral identifiers. Long text elements (exceeding
the label threshold) become :class:`DocProseBlock` entries for
keyword enrichment (2.8.4).

Covers:

- ``<title>`` → top-level heading
- ``<desc>`` → level-2 heading under the document root
- ``<a xlink:href=...>`` → ``DocLink`` entry
- **Containment tree** — shapes (rect, circle, ellipse, polygon,
  path) form a nesting hierarchy; text elements attach to the
  smallest containing box
- **Three-level labeling** — explicit group label → single-text
  inference → neutral identifier
- **Auto-id filtering** — Inkscape-style ``g123`` / ``Group_42``
  ids are treated as if no id were set
- **Reading order** — y-then-x sort at each nesting level
- **Shape-less fallback** — spatial clustering when no shapes
  are present (text-only SVGs)
- **Long-text prose blocks** — text elements exceeding the label
  threshold become :class:`DocProseBlock` entries attached to
  the containing shape (or document root)
- Text label deduplication
- Non-visual element filtering

Uses stdlib ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` only — no external XML
dependencies. Parse failures are caught and produce an empty
outline rather than propagating: an unparseable SVG should not
take down indexing of the rest of the repo.

Keyword enrichment (2.8.4) consumes ``outline.prose_blocks`` to
populate each block's ``keywords`` field. The enricher and this
extractor share one threshold — :data:`_LONG_TEXT_THRESHOLD` —
so short labels stay as heading leaves and only body-prose text
gets enriched.

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/document-index.md``.
