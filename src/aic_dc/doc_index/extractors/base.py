"""Base class for document extractors.

Defines the contract every per-format extractor implements. Deliberately
thin — the base class provides no shared parsing helpers because markdown
and SVG have nothing in common mechanically. Shared infrastructure lives
at the orchestrator level (cache, formatter, reference index).

Per-extractor state across calls is none — extractors are stateless.
The orchestrator constructs one instance per format and reuses it.

    """Abstract base for per-format document extractors.

    Subclasses must override :meth:`extract` to parse the file
    content and return a populated :class:`DocOutline`.

    The :attr:`extension` class attribute identifies the file
    extension(s) this extractor handles. The registry in
    :mod:`aic_dc.doc_index.extractors` uses it to build the
    dispatch table. A subclass handling multiple extensions
    (markdown covers ``.md`` and ``.markdown``) registers under
    each.

    :attr:`supports_enrichment` indicates whether the extractor
    produces content suitable for keyword enrichment. Markdown:
    True (section prose between headings). SVG: True when prose
    blocks are present, False when the file is purely labels —
    but the class-level default doesn't know this, so the
    orchestrator checks per-outline via the outline's contents.
    The flag is a coarse hint; the orchestrator's per-file
    decision is what actually gates enrichment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path:
            Repo-relative path the outline will be keyed by.
            The extractor uses it for :attr:`DocOutline.file_path`

            path heuristics.
        content:
            Full file content as a single string. The orchestrator
            reads the file once and passes the content; extractors
            don't do their own I/O.

        -------
        DocOutline
            Populated with headings, links, doc_type, and
            (SVG only) prose_blocks. The keyword enricher
            (2.8.4) fills in the ``keywords`` fields post hoc;
            extractors leave them as the default empty lists.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
