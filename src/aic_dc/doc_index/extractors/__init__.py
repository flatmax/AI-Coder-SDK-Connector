"""Per-format document extractors.

Registry of extension → extractor class. Consumers (the
:class:`aic_dc.doc_index.index.DocIndex` orchestrator) dispatch
by file extension; unknown extensions produce no outline.

Registry design matches the symbol index's per-language dispatch
pattern. Instances are constructed once per orchestrator and
reused across files — extractors are stateless across calls.

Currently registered:

- ``.md`` / ``.markdown`` — :class:`MarkdownExtractor`
- ``.svg`` — :class:`SvgExtractor` (2.8.3c minimal baseline;
  containment tree and prose blocks land in 2.8.3d / 2.8.3e)
