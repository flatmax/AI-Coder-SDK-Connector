"""Data model for the document index.

Mirrors :mod:`aic_dc.symbol_index.models` in shape — mutable
dataclasses that the orchestrator treats as read-only snapshots
within a request boundary (D10 contract). The mutability is for
the extraction pass; once an outline is stored in
:attr:`DocIndex._all_outlines`, it is queried but not written.

The model carries three classes of edges:

1. **Document-level links** (``DocLink`` on :attr:`DocOutline.links`)
   — every `[text](path)` or `![alt](path)` match the extractor
   found, with the heading under which the link appears recorded
   for cross-reference context.

2. **Section-level outgoing refs** (``DocSectionRef`` on
   :attr:`DocHeading.outgoing_refs`) — computed by the reference
   index in a second pass from document-level links. Each entry
   says "this heading contains a link to that document's specific
   section".

3. **Incoming ref count** (:attr:`DocHeading.incoming_ref_count`)
   — also computed by the reference index, counting sections in
   other documents that link to this heading.

SVG prose blocks (:class:`DocProseBlock`) are the path for
long-text SVG elements that would otherwise drown out label siblings.
They carry raw text so :mod:`aic_dc.doc_index.keyword_enricher` can
process them alongside markdown sections (2.8.4). The formatter
renders them as ``[prose] (kw1, kw2)`` entries under their
containing heading.

    Trees of headings form the outline structure. A heading's

    for SVG. Nesting is via the :attr:`children` list — the
    extractor rebuilds the tree from level transitions (markdown)
    or box containment (SVG).

    :attr:`keywords` is populated by the keyword enricher in a
    post-extraction pass (2.8.4). Before then, or when the
    enricher is unavailable, the list is empty and the formatter
    omits the parenthetical keyword annotation.

    :attr:`outgoing_refs` is populated by the reference index

    :attr:`incoming_ref_count` is also populated by the reference
    index — zero before the pass or for headings with no inbound
    references.

    :attr:`content_types` carries markers detected during
    extraction: ``"table"``, ``"code"``, ``"formula"``. Each marker
    appears at most once per heading regardless of how many
    instances the section contains. Empty list for sections with
    none of the detected content types.

    :attr:`section_lines` is the line count from this heading's
    start line to the next heading's start line (or end of file).
    The formatter omits the annotation below a threshold (default
    5 lines) to reduce noise on trivially short sections.

    :attr:`start_line` is 1-indexed — matches the convention used
