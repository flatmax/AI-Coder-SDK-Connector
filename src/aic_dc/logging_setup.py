"""Logging configuration for AIC-DC.

Installed by :func:`aic_dc.cli.main` before any other code path runs, so
every log statement from Layer 1 onward lands on a consistent handler.
Kept narrow — one public function, idempotent, no global mutable state
beyond what :mod:`logging` already owns.

Idempotence matters because:

- Tests import and configure the logger repeatedly.
- Future hot-reload paths (e.g. re-applying user config after a settings
  edit) may want to re-invoke ``configure`` with a different verbosity
  without stacking handlers.

Noisy-library capping matters because:

- ``--verbose`` sets the root to DEBUG, which otherwise floods the
  console with per-frame WebSocket logs and per-request HTTP payloads.
  Our own DEBUG output would be unreadable.
- The cap is INFO rather than WARNING so operators can still see
  meaningful library-level messages (connection lifecycle, request
  start/end) without drowning in per-frame chatter.

stderr rather than stdout because:

- stdout is reserved for protocol output in future layers (e.g. a
  subprocess pipe for the Vite dev server, or machine-readable RPC
  dumps). Log noise on stdout could corrupt that channel.
- Matches the established CLI convention (git, ssh, build tools all
  log to stderr).
