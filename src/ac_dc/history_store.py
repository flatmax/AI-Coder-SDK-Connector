"""Persistent conversation history — append-only JSONL store.

Stores one JSON record per line in ``.ac-dc4/history.jsonl`` under
the repo root. Each record captures one user or assistant message
plus enough metadata to reconstruct the conversation on session
load: role, content, timestamp, session ID, and optional fields
for files-in-context, files modified, edit results, and image
references.

Image data URIs pasted into messages are decoded and saved as
separate files in ``.ac-dc4/images/`` so the JSONL file itself
doesn't balloon with megabytes of base64 per image. The filename
is ``{epoch_ms}-{sha256_prefix}.{ext}`` — deterministic per
content, so re-pasting the same image produces one file on disk.
Matches specs4/4-features/images.md's content-hash dedup rule.

Design points pinned by specs4/3-llm/history.md:

- **Append-only.** Every write is an append to the JSONL file.
  Mid-write crashes leave partial lines which are tolerated by
  the reader (per-line JSON parse with warning-log on failure).
- **Write-before-broadcast.** The streaming handler persists the
  user message before the LLM call starts — intentional so a
  mid-stream crash preserves user intent rather than losing it.
- **Session IDs group messages.** No dedicated "session"
  document exists on disk; sessions are emergent from the set
  of records sharing a session_id. Listing sessions is a scan.
- **Retrieval asymmetry.** Two read paths exist:
  ``get_session_messages`` returns full metadata for the history
  browser; ``get_session_messages_for_context`` returns a
  compact role/content shape with reconstructed image data URIs
  for replaying a past conversation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        session_id:
            The session this message belongs to. Caller manages
            session identity; the store never generates session
            IDs implicitly.
        role:
            ``"user"`` or ``"assistant"``. System-event messages
            use ``role="user"`` with ``system_event=True`` so the
            LLM sees them in context — a separate role would
            require per-provider mapping.
        content:
            The message text.
        files:
            Optional list of repo-relative paths that were in
            context when the user sent this message (user
            messages only). Persisted for the history browser;
            not used by the context retrieval path.
        images:
            Optional list of base64 data URIs to save as
            separate files. Accepts an ``int`` count as a
            legacy shape — records with integer counts load
            back without images (the images weren't saved
            at write time). New callers should always pass
            the data URI list.
        files_modified:
            Optional list of repo-relative paths modified by
            this assistant message's edits.
        edit_results:
            Optional per-edit status records for the history
            browser (status, error, old/new previews).
        system_event:
            When True, marks this message as a system event
            (commit, reset, mode switch) — rendered distinctly
            in the chat UI.
        turn_id:
            Optional turn identifier grouping this record with
            other records produced by the same user request.
            Per specs4/3-llm/history.md § Turns, every record
            in a turn (user message, assistant response, any
            system events fired during the turn, and the
            compaction event if one fires post-response) carries
            the same turn_id. The turn_id is generated at the
            top of the streaming pipeline and propagated
            through. Omitted from records whose callers haven't
            yet adopted turn propagation — readers tolerate its
            absence and the chat panel simply does not offer
            the "show agents" affordance for records lacking it.
        agent_blocks:
            Optional ordered list of ``{id, agent_idx}`` entries
            naming every agent the orchestrator spawned in this
            turn. Persisted only on assistant records produced
            by an agent-spawning turn. Per specs4/3-llm/history.md
            § Cross-Turn Agent Reconstruction, the list lets a
            future "show me everything agent-X did across the
            session" view recover the per-turn id↔agent_idx
            mapping without scanning archive contents. Omitted
            from records whose turn did not spawn agents and
            from records predating cross-turn reconstruction —
            readers skip such records when filtering by agent
            id rather than guessing at the mapping.

        turn_id:

        Writes to ``agent-NN.jsonl`` where ``NN`` is
        ``agent_idx`` zero-padded to 2 digits. Re-iteration within
        a turn (main LLM spawns agents, reviews, spawns different

            iterations — agent 0 in iteration 2 writes to the same
            file as agent 0 in iteration 1. Must be non-negative.
        role:
            ``"user"`` or ``"assistant"``. Agent ContextManagers
            record their initial prompt as ``role="user"`` (the
            task string from the main LLM's spawn block) and their
            responses as ``role="assistant"``.
        content:
            The message text.
        session_id:
            Optional session identifier for back-reference to the
            user session that triggered this turn. Matches the
            main store's convention — every record carries a
            session_id. When None, the record omits the field
            (legal for agent archives since they're scoped by
            turn_id rather than session_id).
        system_event:
            Marks operational events (agent spawn, review
            directives). Distinct from the main store's system
            events — agents rarely fire them, but the flag exists
            for symmetry.
        image_refs:
            Optional list of image filenames (from the main
            store's images/ directory). Agents can reference
            images the user pasted into the triggering turn; the
            archive records the reference but the image bytes
            stay in the shared images/ directory, not duplicated
            per agent.
        extra:
            Additional fields to stash on the record (e.g.,
            ``edit_results``, ``files_modified`` if the agent
            emitted edits). Forwarded unchanged; the store
            doesn't interpret them.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            The full record that was persisted. Includes the
            generated ``id``, ``timestamp``, and ``turn_id`` so
            callers can use the ID for follow-up correlation.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``turn_id`` is empty, ``agent_idx`` is negative, or
            ``role`` is not one of the expected values. These are
            programmer errors — the agent-spawning path should
            never produce invalid inputs.

        re-sort.
