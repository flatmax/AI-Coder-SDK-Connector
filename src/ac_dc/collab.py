"""Collaboration mode — Layer 4.4.1.

Admission-gated multi-browser connections on a single backend. The
first connection is auto-admitted as the host; subsequent connections
are held in a pending state until an already-admitted user approves
(or denies) them via a UI prompt. Non-localhost participants can
browse, search, and view state but cannot mutate — the restriction
is enforced at the service layer via :meth:`Collab.is_caller_localhost`
which downstream service methods consult.

Governing spec: ``specs4/4-features/collaboration.md``.

Design points pinned here:

- **``handle_connection`` is fully overridden.** The base
  :class:`JRPCServer` implementation creates a JRPC2 remote
  immediately and starts the ``system.listComponents`` handshake,
  making the client a full participant. We can't let that happen
  before admission approval. The override runs a four-step
  sequence: (1) detect localhost, (2) if first connection
  auto-admit and fall through to normal JRPC setup; (3) otherwise
  send a raw ``admission_pending`` message on the bare WebSocket
  and await approval via an asyncio Future resolved by
  :meth:`Collab.admit_client` / :meth:`Collab.deny_client`; (4) on
  admit, call ``super().handle_connection`` to complete setup; on
  deny or timeout, close the socket with code 1008.

- **Custom message receive loop for caller tracking.** The base
  class runs its receive loop inside ``handle_connection``. For
  admitted clients we must set ``_current_caller_uuid`` on the
  server before each message dispatch so service methods can ask
  "who is calling me?" via :meth:`Collab.is_caller_localhost`.
  This means we replicate the base class's receive loop with an
  extra assignment before ``remote.receive(message)``. The caller
  lives in a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` rather than a plain
  attribute, because dispatching an ``async def`` method only
  *schedules* it — its body, and therefore its localhost gate, runs
  after the loop has cleared the caller again.

- **Raw WebSocket messages before JRPC setup.** Pending clients
  receive JSON frames directly on the underlying WebSocket —
  these are NOT JRPC messages because JRPC hasn't been set up
  yet. The browser-side collab code intercepts these before
  jrpc-oo's message handler sees them (see specs4/4-features/
  collaboration.md#pending-state-pre-jrpc).

- **Localhost detection includes local network interfaces.** A
  user opening their browser via the LAN IP (e.g. for mobile
  testing) rather than via ``localhost`` should still count as
  localhost for mutation purposes. We detect by collecting every
  IP address bound to any local interface and comparing peer IPs
  against the set. Loopback addresses (``127.0.0.0/8``, ``::1``)
  are always localhost regardless of interface detection.

- **Pending queue cancellation on disconnect.** If a pending
  client closes their browser before admission, the admission
  Future is cancelled and the pending request is removed from
  the queue. Without this, stale pending entries would
  accumulate every time a user gave up waiting. Uses
  ``asyncio.wait`` with the Future racing ``websocket.wait_closed``
  so a disconnect wakes the wait loop immediately.

- **Same-IP replacement.** If a browser refreshes while its
  earlier connection is still pending, the old pending request
  is auto-denied and replaced. Prevents a user's browser history
  from accumulating dead pending tabs after a few reloads.

- **Host promotion on disconnect.** When the host disconnects,
  the next admitted client by ``admitted_at`` timestamp is
  promoted to host. Triggers a ``roleChanged`` push to the
  promoted client and a ``clientJoined`` refresh to all clients
  so UI badges update.
