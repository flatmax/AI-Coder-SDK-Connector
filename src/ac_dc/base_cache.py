"""Base class for mtime-based per-file caches.

Shared between :class:`~ac_dc.symbol_index.cache.SymbolCache` and
the future ``DocCache`` (Layer 2.7). Both caches map a repo-relative
file path to an extracted representation of that file, invalidated
when the file's modification time changes.

Design notes pinned by specs4/2-indexing:

- **Storage-mechanism abstraction.** :class:`BaseCache` exposes
  ``get``/``put``/``invalidate``/``clear`` with identical semantics
  for in-memory and on-disk backings. Subclasses override
  ``_persist`` and ``_load_all`` to add disk sidecars. The symbol
  cache leaves both as no-ops; the doc cache implements them.

- **Mtime, not content hash.** Cache invalidation is driven by
  file modification time — cheap to check, correct in the
  overwhelming majority of cases. Mtime false positives (mtime
  bumped by a retab) just trigger a re-parse; correctness is
  preserved.

- **Signature hash for stability tracking.** A separate hash over
  the *extracted* representation (not the raw file) is computed
  on put and exposed via ``get_signature_hash``. The stability
  tracker (Layer 3.5) uses this to detect "structurally
  meaningful" changes — a whitespace edit changes mtime but not
  the signature, so the stability tier doesn't demote.

- **Thread safety not required.** The orchestrator (Layer 2.7)
  drives all cache access from a single executor.

- **Missing mtime is not an error.** ``get`` accepts an mtime
  argument rather than stat-ing the file itself — callers that
  walk the repo already have the mtime in hand. Passing ``None``
  is handled by returning None (cache miss).

Governing specs:

- ``specs4/2-indexing/symbol-index.md#caching``
- ``specs4/2-indexing/document-index.md#disk-persistence``
