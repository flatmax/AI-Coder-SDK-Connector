    """Map a LiteLLM exception to a structured error dict.

    LiteLLM's exception hierarchy normalises provider errors into
    a small set of typed classes — each carrying ``status_code``,
    ``model``, ``llm_provider``, and sometimes ``response`` with
    a ``Retry-After`` header. This classifier reads those
    attributes into a flat dict the frontend can dispatch on.

    Recognised types and their intended UX:

    - ``context_window_exceeded`` — the prompt (including
      history) exceeds the model's input window. Actionable:
      trigger compaction or drop files. Frontend shows a toast
      with a "Compact now" action.
    - ``rate_limit`` — provider throttled the request.
      Actionable: wait and retry. Frontend shows a countdown
      toast using the ``retry_after`` field when populated
      (LiteLLM surfaces the ``Retry-After`` header on the
      exception's ``response`` attribute).
    - ``authentication`` — API key invalid or missing.
      Actionable: edit LLM config. Frontend shows a toast with
      a "Open Settings" action.
    - ``bad_request`` — malformed request (usually a schema
      mismatch between AC⚡DC's request shape and the
      provider's expectations). Actionable: file a bug;
      frontend shows the raw provider message.
    - ``api_connection`` — network/transport failure before the
      request reached the provider. Actionable: check internet /
      corporate proxy.
    - ``service_unavailable`` — provider reported 503 or
      equivalent. Actionable: wait; may retry.
    - ``timeout`` — request took longer than LiteLLM's
      configured timeout.
    - ``not_found`` — model identifier doesn't exist for the
      configured provider. Actionable: verify the model name in
      LLM config.
    - ``llm_error`` — catch-all for exceptions not matching any
      recognised LiteLLM subclass. Original exception type name
      captured in ``original_type`` for debugging.

    The classification tries the most specific types first.
    LiteLLM's class hierarchy has ``ContextWindowExceededError``
    as a subclass of ``BadRequestError`` (400 with specific
    error code), so checking the window error BEFORE the
    generic bad-request matters — otherwise every context
    overflow would be mis-tagged.

# - Explicit retry predicate based on _classify_litellm_error's output —
#   retries on rate_limit, api_connection, service_unavailable, timeout;
#   fails fast on authentication, bad_request, context_window_exceeded,
#   not_found.
# - Retry-After header honoring: if the RateLimitError carries a
#   Retry-After value, wait at least that long on the next attempt.
#
# The outer retry REPLACES the ``num_retries=`` kwarg on call sites that
# use this helper — double-retrying would produce a multiplicative wait
# that's hard to reason about.

    Parameters
    ----------
    litellm_module:
        The imported ``litellm`` module — passed rather than imported here
        so the heavyweight import happens at the call site.
    call:
        Zero-arg callable that invokes ``litellm.completion(...)``. Keeps
        kwargs at the call site where they're readable.
    max_attempts:
        Total attempts including the initial call. ``1`` disables
        retry. Typically sourced from ``config.num_retries + 1``.
    context:
        Human-readable label used in warning logs. Defaults to
        ``"completion"``; callers can pass ``"commit"``,
        ``"topic detector"``, etc.
    on_retry:
        Optional callback invoked AFTER classification and BEFORE
        sleeping, only on retryable errors with attempts remaining.
        Receives a dict with ``attempt`` (1-indexed), ``max_attempts``,
        ``error_type``, ``wait_seconds``, ``message``, ``provider``,
        ``context``. Used by the streaming path to emit UI toasts
        showing retry progress during long backoff waits.
        Callback exceptions are logged at debug and swallowed so a
        faulty hook can't break retry semantics.
    is_cancelled:
        Optional zero-arg predicate polled during the backoff wait
        between attempts. When it returns True, the wait is
        interrupted and :class:`RetryCancelled` is raised — gives
        the user's Stop button a way to break out of a long
        rate-limit backoff (Bedrock 429s schedule waits of 30-60s,
        and the exponential schedule can compound to minutes after
        several attempts). Polled at 200 ms granularity so the UI
        feels responsive without burning CPU.

    Returns
    -------
    The return value of ``call()`` on success.

    Raises
    ------
    :class:`RetryCancelled`
        When ``is_cancelled`` returned True mid-backoff.
    The last exception from ``call()`` once retries are exhausted, or
    immediately on any non-retryable error.
