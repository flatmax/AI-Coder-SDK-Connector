"""Edit pipeline — validate and apply parsed edit blocks.

Takes a sequence of :class:`~ac_dc.edit_protocol.EditBlock`
instances and turns them into :class:`EditResult` records by:

1. Validating anchors against current file content
2. Applying successful edits to disk via the :class:`Repo` layer
3. Marking not-in-context edits without attempting application
4. Staging modified files in git

Governing specs:

- ``specs4/3-llm/edit-protocol.md`` — status codes, error types,
  not-in-context handling, concurrent invocation contract
- ``specs-reference/3-llm/edit-protocol.md`` — concrete anchor
  matching semantics, whitespace diagnostics, sequential
  application rules

## Design Decisions Pinned Here

- **Pure validation + coordination.** The pipeline owns the logic
  for "does this anchor match exactly once, what does the new
  file content look like, was it already applied?" It delegates
  actual disk I/O and git staging to :class:`Repo`, whose
  per-path mutex (D10) makes the apply step safe to invoke
  concurrently across different file batches.

- **Not-in-context is a workflow signal, not a failure.** The LLM
  writing an edit for an unselected file means it guessed the
  old-text from the symbol map alone — unreliable. We mark the
  edit ``NOT_IN_CONTEXT``, don't attempt application, and return
  the file path so the streaming handler can auto-add it to
  selection. Create blocks (empty old-text) bypass this check —
  there's no anchor to guess at.

- **Already-applied detection.** Before reporting an anchor
  failure, check whether the new text is already present. Lets
  users re-run a prompt without flooding the UI with spurious
  errors when the edits already landed. Uses substring search on
  the full new_text — conservative but correct.

- **Sequential application within a batch.** Edits are applied in
  list order. Each edit sees the file state produced by earlier
  edits in the same batch. This matches specs3's sequential
  contract and is what the LLM expects — the system prompt
  tells it to merge adjacent edits rather than emit overlapping
  ones, so sequential application is the right model.

- **Re-entrant across batches.** The pipeline is safe to call
  concurrently for different batches of edits. Per-file
  serialization happens in Repo's write mutex; the pipeline
  itself holds no mutable state between invocations. In
  single-agent operation this is never exercised; the contract
  exists so a future parallel-agent mode (specs4/7-future)
  doesn't need to refactor.

- **Result shape mirrors frontend expectations.** The
  :class:`EditResult` dataclass has exactly the fields the
  streaming handler puts into the ``edit_results`` array of
  ``streamComplete``. Keeps the serialization boundary thin —
  the streaming handler dumps dataclass fields verbatim.

    to selection so the user sees the new file and the next
