"""Cross-document reference graph for the document index.

Mirrors :class:`ac_dc.symbol_index.reference_index.ReferenceIndex`
but operates on :class:`DocOutline` objects instead of
:class:`FileSymbols`. Edges represent "document A's heading links
to document B's heading" rather than "function A calls function B".

Governing spec: ``specs4/2-indexing/document-index.md`` §
Cross-Reference Index.

Design points pinned by the test suite:

- **Section-level incoming counts.** A :class:`DocLink` with
  fragment ``#section-two`` resolves to the specific heading
  and increments that heading's :attr:`DocHeading.incoming_ref_count`.
  A fragment-less link increments the target document's
  top-level heading count — treated as a document-level ref.

- **Self-references dropped.** Links from a document to its own
  headings don't count. Otherwise a README with a ToC would
  inflate every heading's count by one for no useful signal.

- **Per-(source-heading, target-heading) deduplication.** Two
  links from the same source heading to the same target pair
  count once. Matches the code-side reference graph's
  "collapsed weighted edge" model — multiple references are
  still one conceptual "A depends on B" relationship.

- **Unresolved anchors fall back to document-level.** A link
  with a ``#does-not-exist`` fragment still counts — against
  the target document's top-level heading. Better than silently
  losing the signal entirely; the author's *intent* was to
  reference that document.

- **GitHub-style anchor slugging.** Lowercase, spaces →
  hyphens, punctuation stripped. Matches how most markdown
  renderers (and GitHub itself) generate heading anchors.
  Enables cross-document links written with either the original
  heading text as fragment or the rendered slug.

- **Same protocol as code-side reference index.** Exposes
  :meth:`connected_components` and :meth:`file_ref_count` so
  consumers that operate on file-level connectivity (clustering,
  ranking, cross-mode joins) can treat code and doc references
  uniformly without caring about symbol vs doc semantics.

- **Bidirectional-only clustering.** Connected components are
  built from mutual links (A → B AND B → A). One-way links
  don't cluster — matches the code-side rationale that a weak
  signal makes for a cluster nobody would recognise.

- **Image links participate.** A :class:`DocLink` with
  ``is_image=True`` creates edges the same way regular links
  do. Lets a document and the diagram it embeds land in the
  same cluster.

- **Rebuild is fully idempotent.** :meth:`build` clears all
  internal state before processing. Orchestrator calls it after
  every re-index pass; accumulating state across rebuilds would
  produce stale edges to deleted files.

- **Input is authoritative, not validated.** The orchestrator
  (2.8.1f) assembles the outline list; this class trusts that
  every ``file_path`` is canonical and every link's ``target``
  is a repo-relative path (produced by extractors that already
  validated against the repo tree). No re-validation here.
