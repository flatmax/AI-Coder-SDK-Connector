"""Document index orchestrator — Layer 2.8.1f.
Wires extractor registry, cache, reference index, and formatter
into a single entry point. Consumers call :meth:`DocIndex.index_repo`
with a file list (or let it walk the repo itself) and then query
via :meth:`get_doc_map`, :meth:`get_file_doc_block`, or
:meth:`get_signature_hash`.
Mirrors :class:`ac_dc.symbol_index.index.SymbolIndex` —
deliberately similar shape so a caller holding either one can
ask it the same questions. The two shared base classes
(:mod:`ac_dc.base_cache`, :mod:`ac_dc.base_formatter`) depend on
that symmetry, and so will the MCP bridge's ``symbol_map`` and
``doc_outline`` tools (``specs5/3-engine/mcp-bridge.md``).
Design notes pinned by the test suite and spec:
- **Per-file pipeline** — mtime check → extract → resolve
  link paths against repo file set → store. Cached files
  return by reference, preserving identity across calls.
- **Multi-file pipeline** — three phases per ``index_repo``:
  (1) discover files via ``os.walk`` when no explicit list
  given, (2) index each file (cache-aware), (3) prune stale
  entries from both memory and cache BEFORE rebuilding the
  reference graph.
- **Stale-removal ordering** — matches the symbol index
  invariant. The reference index would briefly hold edges
  to/from deleted files if we rebuilt before pruning. Test
  ``test_stale_removal_before_reference_build`` pins this.
- **Structure-only vs enriched cache lookup** — two entry
  points. :meth:`index_file` and :meth:`index_repo` pass the
  ``keyword_model`` through to the cache, so callers that
  require keyword-enriched outlines fail to hit the cache
  when the stored model doesn't match. 2.8.1 callers always
  pass ``None`` (no enrichment yet); 2.8.4 will pass real
  model names.
- **Snapshot discipline (D10)** — read methods don't mutate
  ``_all_outlines``. The reference index is rebuilt only on
  ``index_repo``, not on per-file reads. Within a request
  window the index is a read-only snapshot.
- **Repo file set for link validation** — extractors accept
  ``repo_files`` so image-extension scans validate against
  real paths. A phantom mention ("the old layout.svg was
  removed") doesn't produce an edge. The orchestrator
  builds this set fresh on every ``index_repo`` call from
  the walked file list.
- **Excluded directories match the symbol index** — ``.git``,
  ``.ac-dc``, ``.ac-dc4``, ``node_modules``, ``__pycache__``,
  ``.venv``, ``venv``, ``dist``, ``build``. Changes to
  ``SymbolIndex``'s list should mirror here; a future
  refactor could share the set.
- **Extractor registry dispatch** — ``EXTRACTORS`` maps
  extensions to extractor classes. Unknown extensions return
  None from :meth:`index_file` without error. New format
  support (SVG in 2.8.3) is an entry in the registry plus
  a new extractor class, no orchestrator changes.
- **Two formatters** — one instance for map rendering
  (no line numbers; 2.8.1 doesn't emit line numbers yet),
  one reserved for future LSP-style consumers. Currently
  only the first is built; the second will land when doc-
  mode editor features (if ever) need line-annotated output.

           returns True.
        2. The cache's persisted entry for this path was NOT
           stored with the current enricher's model name.

        The second condition is the load-bearing one for the
        "every restart re-enriches from scratch" bug. Per-
        heading keyword presence alone is insufficient: the
        enricher legitimately produces empty keyword lists for
        short sections, for sections whose candidates fail the
        corpus-frequency filter, and for all-code sections that
        strip to empty. A persisted outline where none of the
        eligible headings received keywords is a valid terminal
        state — re-running the enricher against it on next
        startup produces the same empty result, re-persists
        the same sidecar, and the loop repeats every boot.

        The cache's ``keyword_model`` tag is the authoritative
        "enrichment has run" signal. If the sidecar was written
        by :meth:`enrich_single_file`, the model name is
        present. If a different model is configured now than
        when the sidecar was written, the model-match rule
        (consumer-side, via ``get(path, mtime, keyword_model)``)
        already forces re-extraction of the structural outline,
        which clears any prior keywords — so by the time we
        reach this method, a mismatched-model path has been
        through ``_parse_and_store`` and is in a fresh-
        unenriched state with no sidecar model tag.
