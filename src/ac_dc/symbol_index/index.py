"""Symbol index orchestrator — Layer 2.7.

Wires the parser, per-language extractors, cache, import
resolver, reference graph, and formatters into a single
entry point. Consumers call :meth:`SymbolIndex.index_repo`
with a file list and then query via
:meth:`get_symbol_map` / :meth:`get_file_symbol_block` /
:meth:`get_signature_hash`.

Design notes pinned by the test suite and spec:

- **Per-file pipeline** — check cache → parse → extract →
  post-process (import resolution) → store. mtime-based
  caching means unchanged files are a no-op.

- **Multi-file pipeline** — index each file, prune stale
  entries (both in-memory and cache), resolve cross-file
  call-site targets, rebuild the reference graph.

- **Stale-removal ordering** — pruning happens BEFORE the
  reference graph rebuild. Otherwise the ref index would
  briefly contain edges to/from deleted files.

- **Snapshot discipline** — read methods
  (``get_symbol_map``, ``get_file_symbol_block``,
  ``get_signature_hash``) never mutate state.

- **Two formatter variants** — a context formatter (no
  line numbers, for the LLM) and an LSP formatter (with
  line numbers, for editor features).

- **Dispatch by language name** — each extractor declares
  a ``language`` class attribute matching a key in
  LANGUAGE_MAP. The orchestrator resolves a file's
  language via ``language_for_file`` and picks the
  matching extractor.

- **Path normalisation** — incoming paths normalised to
  forward-slash, leading/trailing-slash-stripped form
  before any cache lookup or dict key.
